To achieve the target color RGB(137, 153, 255) and amount of 135ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since the target color has the highest value in blue, we will need a significant amount of blue paint. The red and green values are closer to each other but are less than half of the blue value.

We can start by adding blue paint to the empty beaker (beaker 5) since it has the highest value in the target color. We will then add red and green in smaller amounts to achieve the desired color. Since we need to reach a total volume of 135ml, we can use the RGB values as a rough guide to the proportions of each color needed.

The target color's blue value is 255, which is the maximum for a single color channel, so we can use this as a reference. The red and green values are approximately half of the blue value, so we can try to maintain this ratio when mixing.

Let's start by adding 85ml of blue to the empty beaker. This will be our base. We then need to add red and green in such a way that their combined volume with blue gives us 135ml. Since the red and green values are 137 and 153 respectively, we can try to keep the ratio of red to green close to 137:153 while also considering the total volume.

If we add 25ml of red and 25ml of green, we will have a total of 135ml (85ml blue + 25ml red + 25ml green). However, this will not give us the exact color we need because the green value is slightly higher than the red value in the target color. To adjust for this, we can add a little more green than red.

Let's try adding 24ml of red and 26ml of green to the 85ml of blue. This will give us a total of 135ml, and it should get us closer to the target color.

We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors. Here's the plan:

The planner's approach to achieving the target color and amount was to use the RGB values as a guide for the proportions of each color needed. The planner aimed to maintain the ratio of red to green close to the target color's ratio while also considering the total volume. The plan was to add 85ml of blue, 24ml of red, and 26ml of green to reach the target amount of 135ml.

Upon examining the trajectory, we can see that the final color in beaker 5 is RGB(47, 50, 161), which is significantly darker than the target color RGB(137, 153, 255). The amount of paint is correct at 135ml, but the color is not bright enough. This suggests that the planner's initial ratios for red and green were too low, and the amount of blue was too high, resulting in a darker mixture.

To correct this, we need to adjust the proportions of the colors to brighten the mixture. Since the target color has a high blue value, we should still have a substantial amount of blue, but we need to increase the amounts of red and green to bring the color closer to the target. Additionally, we can use white paint to brighten the mixture without changing the total amount of paint.

Considering the current state of beaker 5, we can propose adding white paint to brighten the color. However, we must be careful not to exceed the target amount of 135ml. Since the beaker is already at full capacity, we would need to remove some of the existing mixture before adding white.

Here's a proposed adjustment to the plan:
1. Remove some of the existing mixture from beaker 5 to make room for white paint.
2. Add white paint to brighten the color.
3. Adjust the proportions of red and green to better match the target color.

Let's assume we remove 35ml of the existing mixture from beaker 5. We can then add 35ml of white paint to brighten the color. After this, we can adjust the red and green proportions by adding more red and green paint in small increments, ensuring we do not exceed the total volume of 135ml.

Good things you did:
1. You correctly identified the need to use the RGB values as a guide for the proportions of each color.
2. You successfully reached the target amount of 135ml in the mixture.

Things to improve:
1. The produced color RGB(47, 50, 161) is much darker than the target color RGB(137, 153, 255).
    - Consider removing some of the existing mixture (e.g., 35ml) to make room for white paint, which will brighten the color.
    - After removing 35ml, add 35ml of white paint from beaker 3 to beaker 5 to lighten the mixture.
2. The proportions of red and green need to be increased to match the target color more closely.
    - After adding white, incrementally add more red and green paint, ensuring the total volume remains at 135ml.
    - For example, you could try adding an additional 5ml of red and 5ml of green to see how this affects the color, and then adjust as necessary.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to create a mixture that is both the correct color and amount.

Based on the feedback, the previous plan resulted in a mixture that was too dark and did not have the correct proportions of red and green to match the target color. To correct this, we need to lighten the mixture by adding white paint and adjust the proportions of red and green.

The target color has a high blue value (255), which is already the maximum for a single color channel, so we will maintain a significant amount of blue in our mixture. However, we need to increase the red and green values to get closer to the target color. Since the target color is lighter than the previous mixture, we will need to add white paint to brighten the color.

To achieve the correct color and amount, we will start by creating a base with blue paint and then adjust the red and green values. After that, we will add white paint to lighten the mixture. We will need to ensure that the total volume remains at 135ml.

We will use the empty beaker (beaker 5) to mix our colors. Here's the revised plan based on the feedback:

1. Pour 85ml of blue paint into beaker 5 to create the base.
2. Add 24ml of red and 26ml of green to beaker 5, as per the previous plan.
3. Remove 35ml of the mixture from beaker 5 to make room for the white paint.
4. Add 35ml of white paint from beaker 3 to beaker 5 to lighten the mixture.
5. Incrementally add more red and green paint to adjust the color, ensuring the total volume remains at 135ml. We will start by adding an additional 5ml of red and 5ml of green.

We will need to monitor the color after each step to ensure we are moving closer to the target color. If necessary, we can adjust the amounts of red, green, or white paint added in the final steps.

The revised plan aimed to correct the color brightness and proportions of the previous mixture. The planner's strategy to add white paint to lighten the mixture was a step in the right direction. However, there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. The final mixture in beaker 5 has a color of RGB(104, 107, 174) and an amount of 145ml, which exceeds the target amount of 135ml. This indicates that the plan did not account for the volume increase when adding additional paint to adjust the color.

2. The color of the final mixture is still not bright enough and does not match the target color RGB(137, 153, 255). The red and green values are particularly lower than the target, suggesting that more of these colors need to be added.

3. The plan included a step to remove 35ml of the mixture to make room for white paint. While this was a good idea, the subsequent addition of red and green paint increased the total volume beyond the target amount.

To improve the plan, the following adjustments should be made:

- Calculate the exact amounts of red, green, and blue paint needed to match the target color's RGB values, considering the addition of white paint to lighten the mixture.
- Ensure that the total volume of paint in the mixing beaker does not exceed the target amount of 135ml. This may require adjusting the amounts of paint added or removed during the mixing process.
- Incrementally add red and green paint after adding white to fine-tune the color, being mindful of the total volume.

The planner should also consider the dilution effect of adding white paint, which will affect the intensity of the other colors in the mixture. A more precise approach to adjusting the color after adding white paint is needed.

Good things you did:
1. The idea to add white paint to lighten the mixture was correct and necessary.
2. The incremental approach to adding red and green paint to adjust the color was a good strategy.

Things to improve:
1. The final mixture exceeded the target amount. In the next iteration, ensure that the total volume of paint in the mixing beaker does not exceed 135ml. This may involve more precise measurements or removing excess paint before adding more colors.
2. The color of the final mixture is still not matching the target. Consider recalculating the amounts of red, green, and blue needed to achieve the target RGB values, taking into account the dilution effect of white paint.
3. The plan should include steps to incrementally add red and green paint after adding white, with careful monitoring of the color and volume. For example, after adding 35ml of white, add 10ml of red and 10ml of green, then assess the color before proceeding.

Specific ml amounts for the next iteration:
- After adding 35ml of white, try adding 10ml of red and 10ml of green to the mixture.
- If the color is still not bright enough, consider adding another 5-10ml of white paint, but be sure to remove an equal amount of the mixture beforehand to maintain the target volume.
- Continue to adjust the red and green values incrementally, in 5ml increments, while constantly comparing the color to the target and keeping the total volume at 135ml.

By following these suggestions, the planner should be able to create a mixture that more closely matches the target color and amount.

To address the feedback and create a mixture that matches the target color (RGB(137, 153, 255)) and amount (135ml), we need to carefully balance the proportions of red, green, blue, and white paint. The target color is a light blue with moderate amounts of red and green.

The feedback suggests that we need to be more precise with our measurements and ensure that the total volume does not exceed 135ml. We also need to adjust the color after adding white paint to lighten the mixture.

Given that the blue value in the target color is at its maximum (255), we will use blue as our base color. We will then add red and green in smaller amounts to reach the desired RGB values. White paint will be used to achieve the lightness of the target color.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Here's the plan:

1. Pour 85ml of blue paint into beaker 5 to create the base, as this is the predominant color in the target.
2. Add 10ml of red and 10ml of green to beaker 5 to start adjusting the color towards the target.
3. Add 30ml of white paint to lighten the mixture, ensuring we leave room for further adjustments.
4. After adding white, assess the color and incrementally add more red and green paint, in 5ml increments, while monitoring the color and volume.
5. If necessary, remove some of the mixture before adding more paint to maintain the target volume of 135ml.

We will need to monitor the color after each addition and adjust the amounts of red, green, or white paint as needed to match the target color while keeping the total volume at 135ml.
