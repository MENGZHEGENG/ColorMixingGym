To create the target color RGB(224, 28, 227) in the amount of 106ml, we need to mix red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. The target color is a shade of magenta, which means it is primarily a mix of red and blue with very little green.

Given that the target color has almost equal amounts of red and blue, we should start by mixing red and blue in nearly equal amounts. Since the green value is very low, we will only need a small amount of green paint.

We also have white (RGB(255, 255, 255)) and black (RGB(0, 0, 0)) paints available, which can be used to lighten or darken the color without changing the hue. However, since the target color is already quite bright, we likely won't need to use much, if any, white or black paint.

To achieve the target amount of 106ml, we need to calculate the proportions of each color based on the target RGB values. We can use the red and blue values as a reference for the proportions since they are nearly equal. We can ignore the green component for now and adjust it later if necessary.

Let's start by mixing equal parts of red and blue to get a base purple color. We can then adjust the color by adding small amounts of green or white/black if needed.

Since the target RGB values for red and blue are 224 out of 255, we can use this ratio to determine the amount of red and blue paint to start with. We can approximate the ratio of red and blue to the total amount (106ml) to get the initial volumes to mix.

Red: (224/255) * 106 ≈ 93ml
Blue: (224/255) * 106 ≈ 93ml
Green: (28/255) * 106 ≈ 12ml

However, we cannot mix more than 106ml total, so we need to adjust these values to fit within the target amount. We can start by mixing 50ml of red and 50ml of blue to get a base color and then adjust from there.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Let's start with the following plan and adjust if necessary.

The planner's approach to creating the target color RGB(224, 28, 227) was to mix red and blue in nearly equal amounts, with a small addition of green. This approach is sound given the target color's composition, which is predominantly magenta—a combination of red and blue.

The planner's initial calculations for the amounts of red and blue paint (93ml each) were based on the correct understanding of the target color's RGB values. However, they correctly adjusted the amounts to 50ml each to avoid exceeding the total volume of 106ml. This shows good adaptability in the planning process.

After executing the plan, the resulting color in beaker 5 is RGB(121, 15, 121), which is a shade of purple but not bright enough and lacking the intensity of the target color. The amount of 106ml is correct, but the color needs to be adjusted to match the target's brightness and hue.

The planner did not use any white or black paint to adjust the brightness or darkness of the color, which could have been beneficial. Since the target color is bright, adding white paint could help achieve the desired brightness.

To improve the color match, the planner should consider the following adjustments:
1. Add white paint to increase the brightness of the mixture. Since the target color has high red and blue values (224), adding white paint will help bring the current color closer to the target.
2. Adjust the amounts of red and blue paint to more closely match the target color's intensity. The current mixture may have too much blue, as indicated by the equal RGB values of red and blue in the mixture.

A possible next step could be to add a specific amount of white paint to the mixture and then fine-tune the color by adding small increments of red or blue as needed.

Good things you did:
1. The approach of starting with equal parts of red and blue was appropriate for creating a base purple color.
2. Adjusting the initial calculated amounts to fit within the target volume of 106ml was a good decision.

Things to improve:
1. The resulting color RGB(121, 15, 121) lacks the brightness and intensity of the target color RGB(224, 28, 227).
    - Consider adding white paint to increase the brightness. Start by adding 20ml of white paint to the mixture and observe the change in brightness.
2. The red and blue values in the mixture need to be closer to the target's intensity.
    - After adding white, if the color is still not bright enough, add an additional 10ml of red paint to enhance the red component, bringing it closer to the target's red value.
    - Monitor the color after each addition to avoid overshooting the desired hue and brightness.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to create a color that is closer to the target in both hue and brightness.

Based on the feedback, the initial plan's mixture was too dark and not as vibrant as the target color. To correct this, we need to increase the brightness and intensity of the color. We can do this by adding white paint, which will lighten the mixture without significantly altering the hue.

The target color RGB(224, 28, 227) is a bright shade of magenta, which means we need a strong presence of both red and blue, with a very small amount of green. Since the target RGB values for red and blue are high (224), we need to ensure that our mixture has a high concentration of these colors. The previous plan did not add enough red and blue to match the target's intensity.

To address the feedback, we will start by adding white paint to the initial purple mixture to increase its brightness. We will then add more red paint to enhance the red component, as suggested. We will also need to adjust the blue component if necessary.

We will continue to use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. The plan will be adjusted to include the addition of white paint and more red paint, while still keeping the total volume at or below the target amount of 106ml.

Let's revise the plan with the following steps:

1. Mix equal parts of red and blue to create a base purple color.
2. Add white paint to increase the brightness of the mixture.
3. Add more red paint to match the target's red intensity.
4. Adjust the green and blue components if necessary, while keeping an eye on the total volume.

We will start with the following proportions based on the feedback:

- 50ml of red paint (from beaker 0)
- 50ml of blue paint (from beaker 2)
- 20ml of white paint (from beaker 3) to increase brightness
- Additional 10ml of red paint (from beaker 0) to enhance the red component
- 6ml of green paint (from beaker 1) to slightly adjust the hue

This gives us a total of 136ml, which is above our target amount. Therefore, we need to reduce the amounts while maintaining the proportions. To fit within the 106ml target, we can scale down the amounts proportionally:

- Red: 50ml + 10ml (additional) = 60ml
- Blue: 50ml
- White: 20ml
- Green: 6ml

Total before scaling: 136ml
Scaling factor: 106ml / 136ml ≈ 0.78

Adjusted amounts:

- Red: 60ml * 0.78 ≈ 47ml
- Blue: 50ml * 0.78 ≈ 39ml
- White: 20ml * 0.78 ≈ 16ml
- Green: 6ml * 0.78 ≈ 5ml

These adjusted amounts sum up to approximately 107ml, which is very close to our target amount. We will round the amounts to the nearest whole number and proceed with the plan.

The revised plan aimed to address the brightness and vibrancy of the color by adding white paint to the mixture and adjusting the amounts of red and blue paint. The trajectory shows that the planner followed the revised plan and ended up with a mixture that is closer to the target color but still not quite there.

The produced mixture in beaker 5 is:

Color: RGB(152, 51, 132), amount: 107ml

The target beaker is:

Target beaker: RGB(224, 28, 227), amount: 106ml.

The produced mixture's amount is slightly over the target, which is acceptable, but the color still lacks the brightness and intensity of the target. The red and blue components are closer to the target, but they are still not bright enough. The addition of white paint has helped, but it seems that the proportions may still need adjustment.

The plan's strategy to add white paint was correct, but the amount may have been too conservative. To improve the color's brightness further, we could consider adding more white paint. Additionally, the red component is still not as high as it should be, so we may need to increase the amount of red paint slightly.

The green component was added in a very small amount, which was appropriate given the low green value in the target color. However, we need to ensure that the addition of green does not detract from the overall vibrancy of the magenta color.

For the next iteration, we should consider the following adjustments:

1. Increase the amount of white paint to further brighten the mixture.
2. Slightly increase the amount of red paint to match the target's red intensity.
3. Ensure that the total volume does not exceed the target amount of 106ml.

Based on the current mixture, we could try the following adjustments:

- Add an additional 10ml of white paint to increase brightness.
- Add an additional 5ml of red paint to enhance the red component.
- Ensure that the total volume is adjusted to remain at 106ml by reducing the initial amounts of red and blue paint proportionally.

Good things you did:
1. The addition of white paint to increase brightness was a good strategy.
2. The careful consideration of the green component was appropriate given its low value in the target color.

Things to improve:
1. The produced color RGB(152, 51, 132) is still not as bright and vibrant as the target beaker RGB(224, 28, 227).
    - Consider adding an additional 10ml of white paint to further brighten the mixture.
2. The red component of the mixture needs to be more intense to match the target.
    - Consider adding an additional 5ml of red paint to enhance the red component.
3. Adjust the total volume to ensure it does not exceed the target amount of 106ml.
    - This may involve reducing the initial amounts of red and blue paint proportionally to accommodate the additional white and red paint while keeping the total volume at 106ml.

By making these adjustments, the next iteration of the plan should produce a color that is closer to the target in both brightness and hue.

To address the feedback and improve the previous plan, we need to focus on increasing the brightness and vibrancy of the color to match the target beaker's RGB(224, 28, 227). The feedback suggests adding more white to brighten the mixture and more red to intensify the red component. We also need to ensure that the total volume does not exceed 106ml.

The target color is a bright magenta, which is a combination of red and blue with a very small amount of green. The previous plan's outcome was RGB(152, 51, 132), which is not bright enough and lacks the intensity of the target color.

To correct this, we will:
1. Add an additional 10ml of white paint to the mixture to further increase brightness.
2. Add an additional 5ml of red paint to enhance the red component.
3. Adjust the initial amounts of red and blue paint proportionally to accommodate the additional white and red paint while keeping the total volume at 106ml.

The previous plan had proportions of red, blue, white, and green at 47ml, 39ml, 16ml, and 5ml respectively. We need to add 10ml of white and 5ml of red, which would bring the total to 117ml. To fit within the 106ml target, we need to reduce the initial amounts.

Let's calculate the new proportions:
- Total additional paint to add: 10ml (white) + 5ml (red) = 15ml
- Total volume before adding: 107ml (from previous plan)
- New total volume with additions: 107ml + 15ml = 122ml
- Scaling factor to fit 106ml target: 106ml / 122ml ≈ 0.87

Applying the scaling factor to the previous plan's amounts:
- Red: (47ml + 5ml) * 0.87 ≈ 45ml (rounded down to fit within 106ml)
- Blue: 39ml * 0.87 ≈ 34ml
- White: (16ml + 10ml) * 0.87 ≈ 23ml
- Green: 5ml * 0.87 ≈ 4ml

These new amounts sum up to 106ml, which matches our target volume. We will proceed with the plan using these adjusted amounts.
