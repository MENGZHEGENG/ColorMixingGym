# The target color is a teal-like color with a low amount of red, high green, and high blue.
# We need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions to achieve this.
# Since we have pure primary colors and white and black to adjust brightness and saturation,
# we can start by mixing the primary colors to get the base color and then adjust.

# First, let's create a base color by mixing green and blue to get a cyan-like color.
# We'll start with a higher proportion of green to match the higher green value in the target.
POUR(1, 5, 79) # pour 79 ml of green into beaker 5
POUR(2, 5, 52) # pour 52 ml of blue into beaker 5

# Now we have a base color in beaker 5, but it's too bright and not green enough.
# We need to darken it and adjust the green level. We'll add a small amount of black.
POUR(4, 5, 10) # pour 10 ml of black into beaker 5 to darken the color

# The current mixture in beaker 5 is likely too blue, so we'll add more green to it.
POUR(1, 5, 9) # pour 9 ml of green into beaker 5 to increase the green

# We now have 150ml of mixed paint in beaker 5, but we need only 131ml.
# We'll remove the excess 19ml by pouring it into beaker 4, which already contains black paint.
POUR(5, 4, 19) # pour 19 ml from beaker 5 to beaker 4 to get the correct amount

The planner's strategy was to create a base teal color by mixing green and blue, then adjust the color by adding black to darken it, and finally adjust the volume to the target amount. The planner's reasoning for the initial color mix was sound, aiming to create a cyan-like base before making adjustments.

However, the final color in beaker 5 is RGB(0, 151, 90), which is significantly off from the target color RGB(30, 157, 152). The color is too dark and lacks the necessary red component. The addition of black paint was intended to darken the mixture, but it also desaturated the color, moving it away from the target.

The planner also attempted to adjust the volume of the mixture to the target amount by transferring excess paint to another beaker. This was a good approach to ensure the correct final volume.

To improve the plan, the following adjustments are recommended:

1. Introduce the red component into the mixture. The target color has a small but significant amount of red (30), which was not accounted for in the plan. Adding red paint will help achieve the correct hue.

2. Reconsider the use of black paint. The addition of black paint has made the color too dark and desaturated. Instead, the planner should focus on getting the hue correct before making any adjustments to brightness or saturation.

3. Use white paint to adjust brightness if necessary. If the color is too dark after adding the correct proportions of primary colors, white paint can be used to brighten the mixture without significantly altering the hue.

4. Ensure the final volume is correct. The planner should continue to adjust the volume as they did in the last step, but only after the color has been correctly matched.

Specific feedback on ml amounts will be provided in the final feedback section.

Good things you did:
1. You correctly identified the need to create a base color and then adjust it.
2. You were mindful of the final volume, ensuring it matched the target amount.

Things to improve:
1. The final color lacks the red component. Introduce red into the mixture by adding approximately 5ml of red paint to beaker 5 to get closer to the target hue.
2. The color is too dark and desaturated due to the addition of black paint. In the next iteration, avoid using black paint until the correct hue is achieved.
3. If the color is too dark after adding red, consider using white paint to brighten the mixture. Start with a small amount, such as 5ml, and adjust as needed.
4. Continue to adjust the final volume after the color has been matched. If you need to remove excess paint, do so only after achieving the correct color.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to create a mixture that more closely resembles the target color and maintains the correct volume.

The planner's strategy was to create a base cyan-like color by mixing green and blue, then add red and white to adjust the hue and brightness to match the target color. The planner also correctly adjusted the total volume to the target amount by removing excess paint.

The final color in beaker 5 is RGB(19, 153, 105), which is close to the target color RGB(30, 157, 152). The green value is almost perfect, but the red and blue values need slight adjustments. The red value in the target is higher, and the blue value is slightly lower than in the mixture.

The planner's use of white paint to brighten the color was a good approach, but it seems that the amount was not enough to reach the desired brightness. Additionally, the red component added was not sufficient to match the target color.

The planner should consider the following adjustments:
1. Increase the amount of red paint slightly to match the target's higher red value.
2. Adjust the blue value by either reducing the initial amount of blue paint or by adding a bit more green to lower the blue ratio in the mixture.
3. Add more white paint to increase the brightness of the color to match the target.

Specifically, the planner could try adding an additional 5ml of red to increase the red value and another 5ml of white to brighten the mixture. The blue value can be adjusted by adding more green, but since the green value is almost perfect, this should be done with caution.

Good things you did:
1. The strategy to create a base color and then adjust with red and white was sound.
2. The final amount of paint in beaker 5 matched the target amount exactly.

Things to improve:
1. The red value in the final mixture is too low compared to the target. Consider adding an additional 5ml of red paint to beaker 5 to increase the red value closer to the target's RGB(30, 157, 152).
2. The blue value is slightly too high. Since the green value is almost perfect, carefully adjust the blue by adding a small amount of green if necessary, but be cautious not to alter the green value too much.
3. The mixture needs to be brighter to match the target color. Add an additional 5ml of white paint to beaker 5 to increase the brightness.

By making these adjustments, you should be able to get closer to the target color while maintaining the correct amount of paint.
