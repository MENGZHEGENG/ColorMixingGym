# The target color is a shade of magenta, which is a mix of red and blue with a very small amount of green. 
# The RGB for the target is (224, 28, 227), which means we need a lot of red and blue, and a tiny bit of green.
# Since we need 106ml of the final mixture, we will aim to mix colors in a beaker that can hold this amount.

# First, we calculate the ratios of the RGB values in the target color:
# Red: 224, Green: 28, Blue: 227
# Total: 224 + 28 + 227 = 479
# Red ratio: 224 / 479, Green ratio: 28 / 479, Blue ratio: 227 / 479

# We need to mix the colors in the correct ratios to get the target color.
# We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker.

# We will start by adding red.
POUR(0, 5, 50) # Pour 50ml of red into beaker 5
POUR(0, 5, 50) # Pour another 50ml of red into beaker 5, total red now is 100ml

POUR(2, 5, 50) # Pour 50ml of blue into beaker 5
POUR(2, 5, 50) # Pour another 50ml of blue into beaker 5, total blue now is 100ml

# We have 200ml in beaker 5, but we need only 106ml. We will remove some of the mixture to adjust the amount.
# We will remove 94ml from beaker 5 to leave us with 106ml.
# We will temporarily pour this excess into beaker 4, which currently has black paint that we won't be using.
POUR(5, 4, 94) # Pour 94ml from beaker 5 to beaker 4, leaving 106ml in beaker 5

# Now we need to add a small amount of green to beaker 5.
# Since the amount of green is very small compared to red and blue, we will add just a bit of green.
POUR(1, 5, 3) # Pour 3ml of green into beaker 5

# We have now mixed the colors in the approximate ratio needed for the target color.
# The total amount in beaker 5 should now be 106ml, which matches the target amount.

The planner's strategy was to create a shade of magenta by mixing red and blue with a very small amount of green. The planner correctly identified the need for a dominant amount of red and blue, given the target color's RGB values (224, 28, 227). However, there are several issues with the execution of the plan:

1. The planner did not calculate the exact amounts of each color needed based on the target RGB values and the final mixture amount. Instead, they poured equal amounts of red and blue (100ml each) without considering the specific ratios required.

2. The planner attempted to adjust the total volume of the mixture after mixing the red and blue by transferring excess paint to another beaker. This step was unnecessary and complicated the process. It would have been more efficient to calculate the correct amounts to pour initially.

3. The amount of green added (3ml) was arbitrary and not based on the calculated ratio. This could lead to an incorrect shade of the target color.

4. The final color in beaker 5 (RGB(125, 8, 125)) is significantly darker and less vibrant than the target color. This suggests that the ratios of red and blue were incorrect, and the mixture may benefit from the addition of white to increase brightness and achieve the correct hue.

To improve the plan, the planner should:

- Calculate the exact amounts of red, blue, and green needed based on the target RGB values and the final mixture amount (106ml).
- Pour the calculated amounts directly into the mixing beaker without the need to transfer excess paint afterward.
- Consider using white paint to adjust the brightness of the color if necessary.

Let's calculate the correct amounts to pour:

The total of the target RGB values is 224 (red) + 28 (green) + 227 (blue) = 479.

The ratios for each color are:
- Red: 224 / 479
- Green: 28 / 479
- Blue: 227 / 479

Multiplying these ratios by the final mixture amount (106ml) gives us the amounts to pour:
- Red: (224 / 479) * 106 ≈ 49.7ml, round to 50ml
- Green: (28 / 479) * 106 ≈ 6.2ml, round to 6ml
- Blue: (227 / 479) * 106 ≈ 50.1ml, round to 50ml

The total amount poured would be 50ml (red) + 6ml (green) + 50ml (blue) = 106ml, which matches the target amount.

If the color is not bright enough, we can add white paint to adjust. Since the target color is vibrant, we should be cautious with the amount of white added. A small amount, such as 5ml, could be tested first.

Good things you did:
1. You correctly identified the need for a dominant amount of red and blue in the mixture.
2. You used beaker 5 as a dedicated mixing beaker, which is a good practice for clarity and organization.

Things to improve:
1. The color ratios were not calculated correctly. You need to use the target RGB values to determine the exact amounts of each color to pour:
    - Pour 50ml of red (RGB(255, 0, 0)) into beaker 5.
    - Pour 6ml of green (RGB(0, 255, 0)) into beaker 5.
    - Pour 50ml of blue (RGB(0, 0, 255)) into beaker 5.
2. Avoid transferring excess paint after mixing. Calculate and pour the correct amounts initially to match the target volume of 106ml.
3. If the color is not bright enough, consider adding a small amount of white paint (around 5ml) to adjust the brightness. Be cautious with the amount to avoid diluting the color too much.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to create a mixture that closely matches the target color and amount.

The planner's approach to creating the target color in beaker 5 was methodical and based on the correct understanding of color mixing. The planner calculated the ratios of the primary colors needed to achieve the target color and rounded the amounts to whole numbers, which is necessary given the constraints of the environment.

However, there are a few issues with the execution of the plan:

1. The final color in beaker 5 is RGB(128, 26, 128), which is significantly less bright and saturated than the target color RGB(224, 28, 227). This suggests that the planner's method of rounding the color ratios may have led to a less accurate color mix.

2. The addition of white paint was intended to adjust the brightness, but the amount added was too small to have a significant impact on the overall color. Moreover, the addition of white paint increased the total volume to 111ml, which is over the target volume of 106ml.

3. The planner did not consider using black paint from beaker 4 to adjust the color if necessary. While the target color does not require darkening, it's important to remember that black paint can be used to adjust the color if it becomes too bright or saturated.

To improve the plan, the planner should consider the following:

- Use a more precise method for calculating the paint amounts to avoid significant rounding errors. This could involve using a larger base number to calculate the ratios before rounding to whole numbers.
- If the color needs to be brighter, consider adding more white paint in increments, checking the color after each addition.
- Ensure that the total volume does not exceed the target volume. If necessary, adjust the amounts of primary colors to account for the addition of white paint.
- Remember that black paint can be used to adjust the color if it becomes too bright or saturated after adding white.

Good things you did:
1. You correctly identified the primary colors needed to create the target color and calculated their ratios.
2. You used beaker 5 as a dedicated mixing beaker, which is a good practice for clarity and organization.

Things to improve:
1. The final color is not bright or saturated enough. Consider recalculating the paint amounts using a larger base number before rounding to whole numbers to minimize rounding errors. For example, multiply the ratios by 1000 before rounding and then scale down to fit the target volume.
2. The addition of white paint was too conservative. Since the target color is quite bright, you may need to add more white paint. Try adding 10ml increments of white paint to beaker 5, checking the color after each addition, until the desired brightness is achieved.
3. Be mindful of the total volume. The addition of white paint should not cause the total volume to exceed the target volume of 106ml. Adjust the primary color amounts accordingly if you plan to add white paint.
4. Remember that black paint is also available for use if the color needs to be darkened or desaturated. However, in this case, it seems unnecessary.

Specific ml amounts for the next iteration:
- Recalculate the primary color amounts using a larger base number for more precision.
- Add white paint in 10ml increments, up to 20ml if necessary, to achieve the desired brightness without exceeding the target volume.
- Adjust the primary color amounts to maintain the target volume after adding white paint.
