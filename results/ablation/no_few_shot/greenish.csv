To achieve the target color RGB(76, 107, 43), we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since we are working with a subtractive color model, we can start by considering the color that needs to be the most dominant in the mix, which is green (107). The red (76) and blue (43) components are less than the green, so we will need less of those colors.

We can start by creating a base green color by mixing some of the pure green paint (Beaker 1) with black (Beaker 4) to darken it. Since we don't have a direct way to measure the resulting color, we'll have to estimate the amounts to mix based on the target color's RGB values. We can then adjust the color by adding small amounts of red and blue.

The target amount is 120ml, which is more than any single beaker's initial amount. This means we will need to combine contents from multiple beakers to reach the desired volume.

Here's a rough plan to start with:
1. Pour some amount of green into Beaker 5 to use as a base.
2. Add a small amount of black to Beaker 5 to darken the green.
3. Add red to Beaker 5 to reach the desired red value.
4. Add blue to Beaker 5 to reach the desired blue value.
5. Adjust the color by adding more of the primary colors if necessary.
6. Ensure the total amount in Beaker 5 is 120ml by adding more of the mixed paint or white if needed to lighten the color.

We will need to iterate on the exact amounts to pour, starting with conservative estimates and adjusting as needed.

The planner's strategy was to create a base color by mixing the primary colors in proportions that would approximate the target color. The planner correctly identified that the target color required a dominant green component, with lesser amounts of red and blue. The planner also recognized the need to darken the green with black paint.

The initial plan to pour 80ml of green into Beaker 5 was a good starting point, as it established a base for the dominant color. Adding 10ml of black to darken the green was a reasonable next step, but the planner may not have considered the impact of black paint on the red and blue components.

Pouring 20ml of red and 10ml of blue into Beaker 5 was an attempt to balance the color components. However, the planner did not provide a method for precise color matching or adjustments based on the resulting color after each pour. The plan also lacked a clear method for ensuring the final volume of 120ml was achieved.

The trajectory shows that the final color in Beaker 5 was RGB(44, 171, 22), which is significantly off from the target color of RGB(76, 107, 43). The green component is too high, the red component is too low, and the blue component is slightly lower than desired. Additionally, the final volume was correct at 120ml, but the color match was not achieved.

The planner should consider the following:
- The impact of black paint on the color balance and how it affects the other components.
- A more iterative approach to adding paint, with smaller increments and checks after each pour.
- A method for fine-tuning the color, such as adding white to lighten or more primary colors to adjust the hue.
- A contingency plan for correcting the color if it deviates from the target.

The planner's initial approach to creating a base color and adjusting from there is a sound strategy. However, there are several areas where the plan could be improved:

1. Incremental Adjustments: Instead of adding 20ml of red and 10ml of blue in one step, consider smaller increments (e.g., 5ml) and check the color after each addition. This allows for finer control over the color mixing process.

2. Color Correction: Include steps for color correction in the plan. If the color is too dark, specify how much white to add. If the color balance is off, provide guidelines on how much more of each primary color to add.

3. Volume Control: The plan should include steps to adjust the volume to the target 120ml after achieving the correct color. If the color is correct but the volume is too low, add white to increase the volume without significantly altering the color.

4. Use of Black: Be cautious with the addition of black paint, as it can quickly overpower the other colors. Consider using less black initially (e.g., 5ml instead of 10ml) and adjust as needed.

5. Testing and Iteration: Implement a testing phase after each action to compare the current color with the target color. This will help in deciding the next steps more accurately.

6. Documentation: Keep detailed records of the amounts added and the resulting color changes. This data will be invaluable for refining the process in future attempts.

By incorporating these suggestions, the planner can improve the precision of the color-mixing process and increase the chances of achieving the target color and volume.

To create the target color RGB(76, 107, 43) in a 120ml volume, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions, considering the subtractive color mixing model. The target color is a shade of green with relatively low red and even lower blue components.

Given the feedback, we should make incremental adjustments and test the color after each addition. We should also be cautious with the use of black, as it can quickly darken the color too much. We need to ensure that we can correct the color and adjust the volume as needed.

Here's the improved plan based on the feedback:
1. Start with the dominant color, which is green, and pour it into an empty beaker (Beaker 5).
2. Add a small amount of black to darken the green, but do so in smaller increments than before.
3. Add red and blue in small increments, checking the color after each addition.
4. If the color is too dark, add white to lighten it without significantly altering the hue.
5. Adjust the volume to 120ml by adding white if the color is correct but the volume is too low.
6. Test the color after each addition and document the changes for future reference.

We will need to iterate on the exact amounts to pour, starting with conservative estimates and adjusting as needed. The goal is to get as close as possible to the target color and volume.

The planner's strategy was to incrementally add the primary colors to an empty beaker, starting with the dominant color (green), and then adjusting the color by adding small amounts of black, red, and blue. The planner also used white to adjust the brightness of the color. This approach is sound in theory, as it allows for gradual adjustments towards the target color.

However, there are a few issues with the execution:

1. The target color has a specific green hue that is not very bright and has more red than blue. The planner added equal amounts of red and blue, which may not yield the exact hue needed.

2. The planner added black early in the process, which could have made it more difficult to achieve the correct hue, as black significantly darkens colors.

3. The final color in Beaker 5 is RGB(66, 194, 66), which is too bright and not close enough to the target color RGB(76, 107, 43). This indicates that the proportions of the colors added were not correct.

4. The final volume in Beaker 5 is 100ml, which is 20ml short of the target volume of 120ml. The planner did not account for the final volume correctly.

5. The planner did not document the changes after each addition, which would have been helpful for understanding the color development and making more informed adjustments.

To improve the plan, the planner should:

- Use a more precise method for determining the proportions of each primary color needed to achieve the target hue.
- Add black paint more cautiously, as it can quickly overpower the other colors.
- Ensure that the final volume is correct by accounting for the volume of each addition.
- Document the color changes after each addition to better understand the effects of each action and to make more informed decisions in the future.

The incremental approach to color mixing is a good strategy, as it allows for careful adjustments. However, the following points should be considered for improvement:

1. Adjust the proportions of red and blue added to the mix. The target color has more red than blue, so consider adding more red than blue in future attempts.

2. Introduce black paint more cautiously and in smaller increments. Black can quickly darken the color, making it difficult to achieve the desired hue.

3. Ensure the final volume matches the target by planning the additions accordingly. You were 20ml short in this attempt.

4. Document the color after each addition to track the changes and make more informed decisions. This will help in understanding the impact of each color addition and in achieving the desired result more efficiently.

5. Consider using a color mixing tool or software to help predict the outcome of mixing specific color proportions, which can guide your plan and reduce the need for trial and error.

By refining the color proportions, being cautious with dark colors, accurately accounting for volume, and documenting the process, the plan can be significantly improved in the next iteration.

To achieve the target color RGB(76, 107, 43) and volume of 120ml, we need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions. The target color is a dark shade of green with more green than red and very little blue. We also need to darken the color, which can be done by adding a small amount of black. We must be cautious with the amount of black to avoid overly darkening the mixture.

Based on the feedback, we should add more red than blue and introduce black very cautiously. We also need to ensure that the final volume is 120ml, so we should plan our additions with the volume in mind. We will use white to adjust the brightness and volume as needed.

Here's the plan:
1. Start with the dominant color, green, and pour it into an empty beaker (Beaker 5).
2. Add red in a higher proportion than blue to match the target color's higher red value.
3. Introduce black paint in very small increments to darken the color.
4. Use white to adjust the brightness and volume as needed.
5. Document the color after each addition to track the changes and make informed decisions.
6. Use a color mixing tool or software to predict the outcome if available.

We will start with conservative estimates for each color and adjust as needed, aiming to get as close as possible to the target color and volume.
