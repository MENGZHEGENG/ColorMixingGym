# The target color is a light shade of orange, which means we need a lot of red, a significant amount of green, and a small amount of blue. We also need to lighten the color, which we can do with white.

# First, let's create a base orange color by mixing red and green.
POUR(0, 5, 100) # Pour 100ml of red into the empty beaker 5
POUR(1, 5, 100) # Pour 100ml of green into beaker 5 with red to mix and create yellow

# Now we have 200ml of yellow in beaker 5. We need to add red to make it orange.
POUR(0, 5, 100) # Pour another 100ml of red into beaker 5 to create orange

# At this point, we have 300ml of orange in beaker 5. We need to lighten this color with white.
POUR(3, 5, 100) # Pour 100ml of white into beaker 5 to lighten the orange

# Now we have 400ml of a lighter orange in beaker 5. We need to add a small amount of blue to achieve the target color.
POUR(2, 5, 10) # Pour 10ml of blue into beaker 5 to adjust the color

# We now have 410ml of paint in beaker 5, which is more than the target amount of 130ml. We need to remove some paint to match the target amount.
# Since we cannot remove paint in this environment, we will create a new mixture with the correct proportions based on the 410ml mixture we have.

# Calculate the proportions of the new mixture based on the 410ml mixture.
# We have 200ml red, 100ml green, 100ml white, and 10ml blue in beaker 5.
# To scale down to 130ml while keeping the proportions, we do the following:
# Red: (200 / 410) * 130 = ~63ml
# Green: (100 / 410) * 130 = ~32ml
# White: (100 / 410) * 130 = ~32ml
# Blue: (10 / 410) * 130 = ~3ml

# Start creating the final mixture in beaker 5.
POUR(0, 5, 63) # Pour 63ml of red into the empty beaker 5
POUR(1, 5, 32) # Pour 32ml of green into beaker 5
POUR(3, 5, 32) # Pour 32ml of white into beaker 5
POUR(2, 5, 3)  # Pour 3ml of blue into beaker 5

# We now have approximately 130ml of the target color in beaker 5.

The planner's initial approach to create a base orange color by mixing red and green was correct, as orange is a secondary color made from these two primary colors. However, there are several issues with the execution of the plan and the understanding of the color mixing process.

1. The planner did not account for the fact that mixing equal amounts of red and green would result in a shade of yellow rather than orange. To create orange, red should be the dominant color.

2. The planner attempted to lighten the color by adding white, which is a correct approach, but they did not adjust the proportions of the other colors accordingly. The addition of white should be done after achieving the correct shade of orange.

3. The planner added blue to the mixture, which is necessary to achieve the target color's slight blue tint. However, the amount added was not based on the correct mixture but rather on the incorrect 400ml mixture.

4. The planner's final steps to create the target mixture were based on the incorrect assumption that the 400ml mixture was correct. They attempted to scale down the proportions to achieve the target amount of 130ml, but since the initial color mixture was incorrect, the final color would also be incorrect.

5. The trajectory shows that the state of beaker 5 did not change after the initial mixing, indicating that the planner's actions to adjust the mixture were not executed. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the environment's capabilities or an error in the plan execution.

To improve the plan, the planner should:

- Adjust the initial ratio of red to green to create a true orange color.
- Add white paint only after achieving the correct shade of orange.
- Calculate the correct amount of blue to add based on the target color's RGB values.
- Ensure that the actions to adjust the mixture are executed and reflected in the trajectory.

Specific feedback on ml amounts and actions:

- To create orange, start with a larger proportion of red compared to green. For example, use 70ml of red and 30ml of green.
- After achieving orange, lighten the color by adding white in small increments, checking the color after each addition.
- Add blue only after the correct shade of orange is achieved, and in a very small amount, as the target color has a low blue value.
- Re-calculate the proportions for the final mixture based on the corrected initial mixture.

Good things you did:
1. Recognizing the need to lighten the color with white paint.

Things to improve:
1. The initial ratio of red to green should create an orange color, not yellow. Consider using 70ml of red and 30ml of green to start.
2. Add white paint only after achieving the correct shade of orange to avoid diluting the color prematurely.
3. The amount of blue added should be based on the correct orange mixture, not the incorrect 400ml mixture. Since the target has a low blue value, consider adding only 1-2ml of blue.
4. Ensure that the plan is executed as intended and that the trajectory reflects the changes made to the mixture.
5. Re-calculate the proportions for the final mixture based on the corrected initial mixture to ensure the final color matches the target.

By following these suggestions, the next iteration of the plan should yield a color closer to the target RGB(254, 222, 197) and the correct amount of 130ml.

The planner's strategy was to create a base orange color by mixing red and green, then adjust the shade with a small amount of blue, and finally lighten the color with white to reach the target amount of 130ml. The planner's approach to creating a base color and then adjusting it is sound in theory.

However, the final color in beaker 5 is RGB(196, 117, 60), which is significantly darker and less saturated than the target color RGB(254, 222, 197). The planner's use of white paint was on the right track, but the amount was insufficient to achieve the desired brightness and saturation.

The planner should consider the following:
1. The initial ratio of red to green to create the base orange color may need to be adjusted. The target color has a high red and green value, with red being slightly more dominant.
2. The amount of white paint added was not enough to achieve the desired brightness. Since the target color is very light, a larger proportion of white is needed.
3. The addition of blue should be carefully controlled, as it can quickly darken and desaturate the color.

To improve the color match, the planner should:
1. Adjust the base orange color to more closely match the target's saturation.
2. Significantly increase the amount of white paint to lighten the color.
3. Re-evaluate the need for blue paint, as the target color has a very low blue value.

Specifically, the planner could try the following adjustments:
- Increase the amount of white paint added to perhaps 50ml or more, observing the effect on the color brightness and saturation.
- Adjust the initial red to green ratio to more closely match the target color's saturation, possibly using a ratio closer to the target's red to green ratio.
- Be cautious with the addition of blue, as the target color has a very low blue value, and even 1ml can have a significant impact on the final color.

By making these adjustments, the planner should be able to create a color that is closer to the target in both hue and brightness.

Good things you did:
1. Your approach to creating a base color and then adjusting it is a good strategy.
2. You correctly identified the need to lighten the color with white paint to match the target color's brightness.

Things to improve:
1. The final color is too dark and not saturated enough. Consider increasing the amount of white paint significantly. Try adding 50ml of white to start with and adjust from there.
2. The initial ratio of red to green may need to be adjusted to more closely match the target's saturation. The target color has a high red and green value, with red being slightly more dominant. Consider using a ratio closer to the target's red to green ratio.
3. Be cautious with the addition of blue paint. The target color has a very low blue value, and even a small amount can significantly affect the final color. You may want to reduce the blue added to less than 1ml or omit it entirely based on the effect of the other adjustments.

By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to create a mixture that more closely resembles the target color in both hue and brightness.
