To achieve the target color of RGB(100, 0, 100) and the amount of 150ml, we need to mix red (RGB(255, 0, 0)) and blue (RGB(0, 0, 255)) in the correct proportions. Since the target color has equal amounts of red and blue, we should aim for a 1:1 ratio of red to blue. However, the target RGB values are less than the maximum of 255, indicating that we need to dilute the intensity of the colors. We can do this by adding white (RGB(255, 255, 255)) to the mix.

To get the correct intensity, we can start by mixing equal parts of red and blue to get purple, and then add white until we reach the desired RGB values. Since we need 150ml of the final mixture, and the target RGB values are less than half of 255, we can estimate that we'll need less than half of the red and blue, and the rest will be white.

Let's start by mixing 50ml of red and 50ml of blue to get 100ml of a bright purple (RGB(255, 0, 255)). Then, we can add white to reduce the intensity. We'll need to add 50ml of white to reach the target amount of 150ml. This should bring us close to the target color, but we may need to adjust the amounts slightly after testing the initial mix.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Here's the initial plan:

1. Mix equal parts of red and blue to create a bright purple.
2. Add white to reduce the intensity and reach the target amount.

The previous plan aimed to create a purple color by mixing red and blue in equal parts and then diluting the intensity with white. However, the final color in beaker 5 ended up being RGB(171, 85, 171), which is too light and not the correct shade of purple we are aiming for. The target color is RGB(100, 0, 100), which is a darker shade of purple.

To correct this, we need to adjust the proportions of red, blue, and white. Since the target RGB values are less than 255 but more than half of 255, we should use more than half of the red and blue compared to white. We also need to ensure that the green value remains at 0, which means we should not add any green paint or white paint in excess, as white contains green.

A possible approach is to start with a base of red and blue mixed in equal parts to create a pure purple, and then add white in smaller increments to lighten the color to the desired level. Since we need 150ml of the final mixture, we can try mixing 60ml of red and 60ml of blue to get 120ml of a bright purple. Then, we can add 30ml of white to lighten the color and reach the target amount of 150ml. This should give us a darker purple that is closer to the target color.

We will continue to use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Here's the revised plan:

1. Mix 60ml of red and 60ml of blue to create a darker purple.
2. Add 30ml of white to lighten the color to the desired level and reach the target amount.

The feedback indicates that the previous plan resulted in a color that was too light, with an RGB value of (154, 51, 154), which is not close enough to the target color of (100, 0, 100). The previous plan used equal parts of red and blue and then added white to lighten the color. However, the addition of white also introduced green, which is not present in the target color.

To achieve the target color, we need to mix red and blue to create purple without introducing any green. Since the target RGB values are (100, 0, 100), we need to create a purple that is less intense than the maximum value of 255 but still maintains the same ratio of red to blue, which is 1:1.

To do this, we can mix red and blue in equal amounts to create a base purple color and then adjust the intensity to match the target RGB values. We can use the black paint to darken the color if necessary, as black will not introduce any other colors into the mix.

Given that we need 150ml of the final mixture, we can start by mixing 75ml of red and 75ml of blue to create a base purple. If this purple is too bright, we can add black paint in small increments to darken the color to the desired level.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Here's the plan:

1. Mix 75ml of red and 75ml of blue to create a base purple.
2. If the color is too bright, add black paint in small increments to darken the color to the desired level.
3. Ensure the final amount in beaker 5 is 150ml.

Let's proceed with the plan.

# At this point, we have 150ml of a bright purple in beaker 5. If the color is too bright, we will add black paint to darken it.
# Since the target RGB is (100, 0, 100), we need to darken the color without changing the red to blue ratio.
# We will add black paint in increments of 10ml and check the color after each addition.
# The following steps are conditional and depend on the resulting color after mixing red and blue:
# POUR(4, 5, 10) # pour 10 ml of black paint into beaker 5 to darken the color (repeat as necessary)
