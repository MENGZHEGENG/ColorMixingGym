To achieve the target color RGB(137, 153, 255) with an amount of 135ml, we need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions. The target color is a light shade of blue with some red and green mixed in.

Since the target color has the highest value in blue (255), we will use the blue paint (Beaker 2) as our base. We will need to lighten this blue to reach the light blue shade of the target. We can do this by adding white paint (Beaker 3).

The red (137) and green (153) values are relatively close to each other, so we will need to add both red and green paint, but slightly more green than red to match the target color.

To calculate the exact amounts of each color to mix, we can use the RGB values as a guide. However, since we cannot use mathematical expressions directly in the POUR action, we will need to estimate the proportions.

We can start by adding a large portion of blue since it's the dominant color in the target. We can then add white to lighten the blue. After that, we will add smaller amounts of red and green to achieve the desired shade.

Since we need 135ml in total and the blue is the dominant color, we can start by adding 100ml of blue. We will then add white to lighten it. We can estimate the amount of white by considering that we want to keep the blue as the dominant color but also achieve the lightness of the target color. Let's start with 30ml of white.

After mixing blue and white, we will add red and green. We can start with 3ml of red and 5ml of green, as the green value is slightly higher than the red in the target color. This will give us a total of 138ml, which is slightly more than the target amount. We can then adjust the amounts slightly to reach exactly 135ml.

We will use Beaker 5 as our mixing beaker.

The previous plan aimed to create a light shade of blue with some red and green mixed in, matching the target color RGB(137, 153, 255) and amount of 135ml. The plan involved using blue as the base color and adding white to lighten it, followed by small amounts of red and green. However, the final color achieved in the plan, RGB(64, 61, 247), is significantly darker and less green than the target color.

To correct this, we need to adjust the proportions of white, red, and green to lighten the color and better match the target RGB values. Since the target color is a very light blue, we need to increase the amount of white paint significantly. Additionally, the red and green values in the target are more than half of the blue value, so we need to add more red and green than in the previous plan.

We will start by pouring a large amount of blue (Beaker 2) into the mixing beaker (Beaker 5), then add a significant amount of white (Beaker 3) to lighten the blue. After that, we will add red (Beaker 0) and green (Beaker 1) in proportions that reflect their presence in the target color. Since the target has more green than red, we will add more green paint.

To achieve the target amount of 135ml, we will carefully calculate the amounts of each color to add, keeping in mind that we cannot use mathematical expressions in the POUR action. We will use the following estimated proportions based on the target RGB values:

- Blue (Beaker 2): Since blue is the dominant color, we will start with a large amount, but less than 100ml to leave room for the other colors.
- White (Beaker 3): We will add a significant amount of white to achieve the lightness of the target color.
- Red (Beaker 0) and Green (Beaker 1): We will add these colors in amounts that reflect their presence in the target color, with more green than red.

We will use Beaker 5 as our mixing beaker and adjust the amounts as needed to match the target color and amount as closely as possible.

The target beaker color is a light shade of blue with relatively high red and green values compared to a typical blue. This suggests that the color is a pastel blue, which requires a significant amount of white to achieve the lightness. The previous plan did not add enough white to match the lightness of the target color, and the red and green values were too low.

To correct this, we need to add more white to the mix to lighten the blue. We also need to increase the amounts of red and green to match the target RGB values more closely. Since the target color has a higher green value than red, we should add more green than red. Additionally, we need to ensure that the total volume of paint in the final beaker matches the target amount of 135ml.

We will use the following approach:
- Start with blue as the base since it's the dominant color in the target.
- Add a significant amount of white to achieve the lightness required for a pastel shade.
- Add red and green in proportions that reflect their presence in the target color, with more green than red.
- Adjust the amounts to reach the target volume of 135ml without exceeding it.

We will use Beaker 5 as our mixing beaker and carefully monitor the amounts to match the target color and amount as closely as possible.
