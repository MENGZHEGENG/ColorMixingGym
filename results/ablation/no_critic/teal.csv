To create the target color RGB(21, 144, 164) with an amount of 128ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since we are working with a subtractive color mixing model, we need to consider how the colors combine to absorb light and produce the desired color.

The target color has low red (21), moderate green (144), and high blue (164) components. We will need to mix these colors in such a way that the green and blue are the dominant colors in the mixture. We also have white (RGB(255, 255, 255)) and black (RGB(0, 0, 0)) paints available, which can be used to lighten or darken the color without changing the hue significantly.

To achieve the target amount of 128ml, we need to carefully calculate the amount of each color to pour. Since we have a higher blue component, we will start by pouring blue paint into the empty beaker (beaker 5). Then, we will add green paint to reach the desired green level. Red will be added last and in the smallest amount since it has the lowest value in the target color. We may also need to use white or black paint to adjust the brightness of the color.

We will use trial and error to adjust the proportions, starting with an initial guess based on the RGB values. For simplicity, let's assume we start with equal parts of red, green, and blue, and then adjust from there. We can start with 40ml of blue, 40ml of green, and then add red and possibly white or black to fine-tune the color.

Let's start with the following proportions:
- Blue: 40ml (since blue is the highest component)
- Green: 40ml (to be adjusted later)
- Red: 10ml (since red is the lowest component)

This gives us a total of 90ml. We will need to add 38ml more to reach the target amount of 128ml. We will adjust the green and blue to reach the correct color, and if necessary, add white or black to adjust the brightness.

Let's start with this initial mix and adjust as needed.

The previous plan attempted to create the target color RGB(21, 144, 164) by starting with equal parts of blue and green, and a smaller part of red. However, the final color achieved was RGB(21, 117, 121), which is not close enough to the target color. The green component is too low, and the blue component is too low as well.

To correct this, we need to increase the green and blue components while keeping the red component low, as the target color has a low red value. We also need to ensure that the total amount of paint in the final mixture is 128ml.

Given that the target color has a relatively low red value (21), a higher green value (144), and the highest blue value (164), we should start by adding a significant amount of blue to the mix. Since the target color is a teal-like color, which is a mixture of blue and green, we should focus on getting the right balance between these two colors.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. We can start by pouring a base of blue paint, then incrementally add green until we get close to the target green value. We will add red last, in a very small amount, to fine-tune the color. We may also use white or black to adjust the brightness if necessary.

Let's start with the following proportions based on the target RGB values:
- Blue: 60ml (since blue is the highest component)
- Green: 50ml (to get closer to the target green value)
- Red: 5ml (since red is the lowest component)

This gives us a total of 115ml. We will need to add 13ml more to reach the target amount of 128ml. We will adjust the green and blue to reach the correct color, and if necessary, add white or black to adjust the brightness.

Let's start with this initial mix and adjust as needed.

The previous plan did not achieve the target color, resulting in a mixture with RGB(11, 126, 121) instead of the desired RGB(21, 144, 164). The red component is slightly lower than needed, the green component is significantly lower, and the blue component is also lower than the target.

To correct this, we need to adjust the proportions of the colors. Since the target color has a low red value, a higher green value, and the highest blue value, we should focus on getting the right balance between blue and green, with a small addition of red to reach the target red value.

We will continue to use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. We can start by pouring a base of blue paint, then add green to get closer to the target green value. We will add red last, in a very small amount, to fine-tune the color. We may also use white or black to adjust the brightness if necessary.

Given the target color's RGB values, we can try the following proportions:
- Blue: 64ml (since blue is the highest component and we need more than the previous plan)
- Green: 56ml (to get closer to the target green value)
- Red: 8ml (to slightly increase the red component from the previous plan)

This gives us a total of 128ml, which matches the target amount. We will adjust the green and blue to reach the correct color, and if necessary, add white or black to adjust the brightness.

Let's start with this initial mix and adjust as needed.
