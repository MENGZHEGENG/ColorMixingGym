To create the target color RGB(99, 52, 46) with an amount of 67ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since the target color is a shade of brown, we will need more red than green and blue, and the green and blue values are relatively close to each other.

We can start by determining the ratios of the RGB values in the target color. The target color has the RGB values in the ratio of approximately 99:52:46. To simplify this, we can divide each value by the smallest value (46) to get a ratio of approximately 2:1:1 (rounded to the nearest whole number). This means we need roughly twice as much red as green or blue.

Since we need 67ml of paint in total, we can use the ratios to determine the amount of each primary color needed. We can allocate 34ml for red, 17ml for green, and 16ml for blue. This will give us a total of 67ml (34+17+16).

We can use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. We will start by pouring red paint from beaker 0, then green paint from beaker 1, and finally blue paint from beaker 2. We will not need white or black paint from beakers 3 and 4 for this mixture.

Let's proceed with the plan.

The previous plan aimed to create a shade of brown by mixing red, green, and blue in a ratio that approximates the target color's RGB values. However, the resulting color in beaker 5 (RGB(130, 65, 61)) is not close enough to the target color (RGB(99, 52, 46)). The red value is too high, and the green and blue values are too high as well.

To correct this, we need to adjust the proportions of the colors. Since the target color is a brownish shade, we need to mix all three primary colors, but we also need to darken the color. This can be achieved by adding a small amount of black paint from beaker 4.

We will still use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. To get closer to the target color, we need to reduce the amount of red and slightly adjust the green and blue values. We can try to maintain the ratio of red to green to blue close to the target color's ratio, which is approximately 2:1:1. However, we need to account for the darkening effect of the black paint.

Let's try using 30ml of red, 15ml of green, 14ml of blue, and add 8ml of black to darken the mixture. This will give us a total of 67ml (30+15+14+8).

Let's proceed with the revised plan.

The feedback from the previous plan indicates that the color achieved in beaker 5 (RGB(115, 58, 54)) is still not close enough to the target color (RGB(99, 52, 46)). The red value is too high, and the green and blue values are slightly higher than desired. The addition of black paint helped darken the mixture, but the proportions of red, green, and blue need further adjustment.

To get closer to the target color, we need to reduce the red influence and slightly adjust the green and blue values while maintaining the darkening effect provided by the black paint. The target color's RGB ratio is approximately 2:1:1, but we need to consider the darkening effect of black paint.

Since the previous plan's red value was too high, we should reduce the amount of red paint. We can try using 25ml of red, 15ml of green, 14ml of blue, and 13ml of black. This maintains the total amount at 67ml (25+15+14+13) and should bring us closer to the target color.

Let's proceed with the revised plan.
