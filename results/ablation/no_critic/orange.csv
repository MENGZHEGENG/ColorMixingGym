To create the target color RGB(255, 162, 0), we need to mix red, green, and no blue. Since the target color is a shade of orange, we need a large amount of red and a smaller amount of green. We have pure red, green, and blue colors, as well as white and black. We won't be using blue or black for this mixture.

The target amount is 150ml, which is more than any single beaker's content, so we will need to mix colors in a larger beaker. Beaker 5 is empty and can be used for mixing.

To achieve the target RGB value, we can start by pouring red into beaker 5 and then adding green in smaller amounts until we reach the desired shade. Since we want no blue, we will not use beaker 2 at all.

The target RGB(255, 162, 0) suggests that for every 255 parts of red, we have 162 parts of green. To simplify the ratio, we can think of it as approximately 3 parts of red to 2 parts of green (since 255:162 is roughly equivalent to 3:2).

To get 150ml of paint, we can use 90ml of red and 60ml of green to maintain the 3:2 ratio. This will give us the correct color and the correct amount of paint.

Let's proceed with this plan.

The previous plan aimed to create an orange color by mixing red and green in a 3:2 ratio, which is a simplification of the target color's RGB ratio of 255:162. However, the resulting color in beaker 5 was RGB(153, 102, 0), which is not the target color RGB(255, 162, 0). The mistake in the previous plan was not accounting for the fact that mixing paints in subtractive color mixing does not result in the same RGB values as the input paints.

To correct this, we need to consider that mixing paints subtractively will darken the resulting color. Since we want to achieve a bright orange, we should start with the red paint and then carefully add green until we reach the desired hue. We will not use blue or black, as they would darken the color unnecessarily.

The target color has a full red component (255), so we should use the full intensity of red from beaker 0. The green component is less than the red but still significant (162), so we will need to add a substantial amount of green from beaker 1. We will not use any blue from beaker 2.

To achieve the correct amount of 150ml, we can start by pouring all 100ml of red from beaker 0 into beaker 5. Then, we need to calculate the amount of green to add to match the target color's green value. Since we are starting with a full red value (255), we need to add enough green to make the green value appear as 162 when mixed with the red.

We can use the white paint from beaker 3 to lighten the color if necessary, but we should first try to achieve the correct hue with red and green alone.

Let's proceed with a new plan based on this reasoning.

POUR(0, 5, 100) # pour 100 ml of red paint into empty beaker 5
POUR(1, 5, 63)  # pour 63 ml of green paint into beaker 5 with red paint to approximate the 255:162 ratio

The previous plan attempted to create an orange color by mixing red and green paint, which is a reasonable approach since orange is a secondary color that can be made by mixing primary colors red and yellow. In the RGB color model, yellow can be simulated by mixing red and green. However, the previous plan did not achieve the desired color, resulting in a mixture that was too dark and not the correct hue.

The target color has a full red component (255), which means we should use the full intensity of red from beaker 0. The green component is significant (162), so we will need to add a substantial amount of green from beaker 1. We will not use any blue from beaker 2, as it would not contribute to the orange color we are trying to achieve.

Since the previous plan did not yield the correct color, we need to adjust the amount of green added to the red. The previous plan added 63ml of green, which was not enough to reach the desired green value of 162 in the final mixture. We need to add more green to get closer to the target color.

To achieve the correct amount of 150ml, we can start by pouring all 100ml of red from beaker 0 into beaker 5. Then, we need to add more green than in the previous plan. Since the previous plan's 63ml of green was insufficient, we should try adding a larger proportion of green to red. We might consider a ratio that is closer to the target color's ratio of red to green, which is approximately 255:162 or roughly 3:2 when simplified.

We will also need to account for the fact that we are mixing paints subtractively, which means the colors will blend to a darker shade than the individual components. To counteract this, we can use the white paint from beaker 3 to lighten the color if necessary after we have mixed the red and green.

Let's proceed with a new plan based on this reasoning.
