To create the target color RGB(76, 107, 43) in a 120ml amount, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since we are working with a subtractive color mixing model, we need to consider how the colors combine to absorb light and produce the desired color.

The target color has the highest value in green, followed by red, and then blue. This suggests that we will need more green paint than red or blue. Additionally, we have white and black paint available, which can be used to lighten or darken the color as needed.

To start, we can mix red and green to get yellow, and then add blue to get closer to the target color. We will need to adjust the proportions to get the right shade of green. Since the target color is a dark green, we might need to add some black paint to darken the mixture.

We can use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Let's start by creating a base green color and then adjust it with red, blue, and black to match the target color. We will need to experiment with the proportions, but as a starting point, we can try the following:

- Mix green and red to get a yellowish color, then add blue to get green.
- Adjust the darkness with black paint as needed.

We will aim for a total volume of 120ml, so we need to be careful with the amounts we pour to ensure we do not exceed this volume.

Let's start with a rough estimate of the proportions based on the RGB values:
- Green: 107ml (since green is the dominant color, we start with this as a base)
- Red: 76ml (to mix with green to get a yellowish color)
- Blue: 43ml (to adjust the yellowish color towards green)
- Black: To darken the color as needed

However, these amounts add up to more than 120ml, so we need to scale them down while maintaining the same ratio. To simplify the calculation, we can use the smallest value (43 for blue) as a reference and calculate the other amounts relative to it.

Using the ratio of the RGB values, we get the following proportions:
- Green: 107 / 43 = 2.49
- Red: 76 / 43 = 1.77
- Blue: 43 / 43 = 1

We can round these to the nearest whole number for simplicity:
- Green: 2.5 parts
- Red: 1.75 parts
- Blue: 1 part

Now we need to find the number of parts that add up to 120ml. Since 2.5 + 1.75 + 1 = 5.25 parts, we can divide 120ml by 5.25 to find the volume of one part:
- 120ml / 5.25 ≈ 23ml per part

Now we can calculate the amounts to pour:
- Green: 2.5 parts ≈ 58ml
- Red: 1.75 parts ≈ 40ml
- Blue: 1 part ≈ 23ml

This adds up to 121ml, which is slightly over our target, so we can adjust the amounts slightly to fit within 120ml:
- Green: 57ml
- Red: 40ml
- Blue: 23ml

We will also need to add some black paint to darken the color. We can start with a small amount and adjust as needed. Let's start with 10ml of black paint.

Now we can write the plan with these initial proportions and adjust if necessary.

The previous plan has a logical approach to creating the target color by mixing the primary colors in proportions based on the target RGB values. However, the plan does not account for the subtractive color mixing model correctly, and the final volume exceeds the target amount of 120ml.

In subtractive color mixing, colors are created by subtracting light from white. The primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) mix to create the secondary colors (red, green, blue). In the RGB model, red, green, and blue are considered primary colors, but when mixing paints, we need to think in terms of subtracting light.

The target color, RGB(76, 107, 43), is a shade of green with more green than red and the least amount of blue. To achieve this color, we need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions and possibly use black to darken the color.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker. Since we have pure red, green, and blue paints, we can mix these to get the desired color. We will also use black to adjust the darkness of the color.

To get the correct shade of green, we need to mix green and red to create yellow, then add blue to get green. Since the target green value is higher than the red and blue values, we will start with a base of green and add red and blue accordingly.

We need to scale the RGB values to fit within the 120ml target volume while maintaining the ratio. The sum of the target RGB values is 76 + 107 + 43 = 226. To find the scale factor, we divide the target volume by the sum of the RGB values: 120ml / 226 ≈ 0.53.

Now we can calculate the amounts to pour:
- Green: 107 * 0.53 ≈ 57ml
- Red: 76 * 0.53 ≈ 40ml
- Blue: 43 * 0.53 ≈ 23ml

This adds up to 120ml, which matches our target volume. However, the color might still be too light, so we will add black paint to darken it. We will start with a small amount of black paint and adjust as needed. Let's start with 10ml of black paint, which means we need to reduce the other colors to maintain the 120ml volume.

Adjusting the amounts to account for the black paint:
- Green: 57ml - 5ml (to compensate for black paint) = 52ml
- Red: 40ml - 3ml (to compensate for black paint) = 37ml
- Blue: 23ml - 2ml (to compensate for black paint) = 21ml
- Black: 10ml

Now we can write the plan with these adjusted proportions.

The feedback provided in the previous plan suggests that the approach of mixing primary colors based on the target RGB values was logical but did not account for the subtractive color mixing model correctly. The subtractive color mixing model is indeed different from the additive model used in digital displays. In subtractive mixing, colors are created by the removal of light, as is the case with pigments or dyes.

The target color, RGB(76, 107, 43), is a dark shade of green. To achieve this color, we need to mix the primary colors (red, green, and blue) in the correct proportions and use black to darken the color if necessary. The previous plan's approach to scaling the RGB values to fit the target volume while maintaining the ratio is a good starting point. However, the previous plan did not account for the presence of white paint, which can be used to lighten colors if needed.

Given that we have pure red, green, blue, black, and white paints, we can mix these to get the desired color. The previous plan's calculations for the amounts of each color to pour are a good starting point, but we need to consider the effect of black paint on the final color. Since the target color is quite dark, we may need to use more black paint than initially planned.

The previous plan suggested starting with 10ml of black paint and adjusting the other colors to maintain the 120ml volume. However, the previous plan did not account for the white paint, which could be used to adjust the brightness of the color. Since the target color is dark, we may not need to use white paint at all.

We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker and start with the previous plan's adjusted proportions. We will then evaluate the color and make further adjustments if necessary. It's important to note that the actual color mixing may not be perfectly linear, and the visual match should be prioritized over exact numerical proportions.

Let's proceed with the previous plan's proportions and adjust if necessary after evaluating the color:

- Green: 52ml
- Red: 37ml
- Blue: 21ml
- Black: 10ml

This gives us a total of 120ml, matching our target volume. If the color is too light, we can add more black paint in small increments. If the color is too dark, we may need to add a small amount of white paint to lighten it, but this should be done cautiously to avoid exceeding the target volume.

Now we can write the plan with these considerations in mind.
