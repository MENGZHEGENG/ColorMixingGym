To create the target color RGB(62, 25, 48) with an amount of 86ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since we are working with a subtractive color mixing model, we can also use white and black to lighten or darken the color as needed.

The target color is a shade of purple with more red than blue and very little green. We can start by mixing red and blue to get a base purple color and then adjust the darkness and the red-to-blue ratio to match the target color. We can use black to darken the color if necessary.

Given that we need 86ml of paint in total, we can start by mixing red and blue in a ratio that is close to the ratio of their values in the target color. The red value (62) is higher than the blue value (48), so we can start with a base of more red than blue. We can ignore the green for now since its value is very low (25).

Let's start with a base of 50ml red and 36ml blue to get 86ml of paint. This gives us a ratio that is slightly more red than blue, which we can adjust later if needed. We will mix these in the empty beaker 5.

If the color is too bright, we can add a small amount of black to darken it. We will need to be careful with the amount of black we add, as it can quickly overpower the other colors.

Here's a rough starting point for the proportions based on the target RGB values:
- Red: 62/135 of the total amount (since 62 is the red component of the target color, and the sum of the RGB components is 135)
- Blue: 48/135 of the total amount
- Green: We will initially leave this out since it's a very small component and adding green could take us further away from the target color.

Now, let's calculate the amounts based on these ratios:
- Red: (62/135) * 86ml ≈ 39ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Blue: (48/135) * 86ml ≈ 31ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)

We will start with these amounts and then adjust as needed. If the color is too light, we will add black in small increments.

The previous plan aimed to create a shade of purple by mixing red and blue, with a small addition of black to darken the color. However, the final color achieved in beaker 5 was RGB(117, 0, 92), which is not close enough to the target color RGB(62, 25, 48). The red component is too high, and there is no green present. Additionally, the color is too dark, which suggests that too much black was added.

To correct this, we need to reduce the amount of red and black and introduce a small amount of green to match the target color. Since the target color has a green component of 25, we cannot ignore it completely. We also need to ensure that the total volume of paint is 86ml.

Let's revise the plan with the following adjustments:
- Reduce the amount of red to bring it closer to the target value of 62.
- Introduce a small amount of green to achieve the green component of 25.
- Reduce the amount of black to avoid darkening the color too much.
- Adjust the amount of blue to match the target blue value of 48.

We will start by calculating the new proportions based on the target RGB values, aiming for a total volume of 86ml. We will use the sum of the RGB components (62 + 25 + 48 = 135) to determine the ratios:

- Red: (62/135) * 86ml ≈ 39ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Green: (25/135) * 86ml ≈ 16ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Blue: (48/135) * 86ml ≈ 31ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)

We will start with these amounts and then adjust as needed. If the color is too dark, we will add white instead of black to lighten it. We will add black only if necessary and in very small increments.

Now, let's create a new plan based on these adjustments.

The previous plan attempted to create a color close to the target by mixing red, green, and blue in specific amounts. However, the resulting color was not accurate enough. The feedback suggests that the red component was too high, and there was no green present. Additionally, the color was too dark, indicating an excess of black.

To achieve the target color RGB(62, 25, 48), we need to consider the following:
- The target color has a moderate amount of red, a low amount of green, and a moderate amount of blue.
- The target color is relatively dark, suggesting that we might need to add a small amount of black to achieve the desired darkness.
- The total volume of the paint should be 86ml.

Given that we have primary colors and black and white at our disposal, we can mix these to get the desired color. We will use the RGB values to determine the proportions of each color needed. Since we are working with a subtractive color model, we need to be careful with the amount of each color we add to avoid oversaturating any component.

We will start by calculating the proportions of red, green, and blue based on the target RGB values, aiming for a total volume of 86ml. We will use the sum of the RGB components (62 + 25 + 48 = 135) to determine the ratios:

- Red: (62/135) * 86ml ≈ 39ml
- Green: (25/135) * 86ml ≈ 16ml
- Blue: (48/135) * 86ml ≈ 31ml

However, we need to adjust these values to account for the presence of black in the target color. Since the target color is darker than a pure mix of red, green, and blue would be, we will need to add some black. We will start with the calculated amounts and then add black in small increments to darken the color as needed.

We will also keep in mind that adding white can lighten the color if necessary, but we should do so cautiously to avoid diluting the color too much.

Now, let's create a new plan based on these adjustments.
