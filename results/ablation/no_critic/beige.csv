To create the target color RGB(254, 222, 197) with an amount of 130ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. Since the target color is a light pastel shade, we will also need to use white to lighten the color.

The target color is predominantly red, with high values of green and a slightly lower value of blue. We can start by adding red and then incrementally add green and blue until we get close to the desired color. We will also need to add white to achieve the lightness of the target color.

We can use the subtractive color mixing model to estimate the proportions. The target color has very high red (254), so we will start with a large proportion of red. The green (222) and blue (197) are also high but less than red, so we will add them in smaller quantities. We will also add white to lighten the mixture.

Since we need 130ml of paint in total, we can try to break down the target RGB values proportionally to the amount of paint we need. We can start with an approximation based on the RGB values and then adjust as needed:

- Red: 254/673 * 130 ≈ 49ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Green: 222/673 * 130 ≈ 43ml
- Blue: 197/673 * 130 ≈ 38ml
- White: To make up the remaining amount to 130ml and lighten the color.

We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors. Let's start by adding the calculated amounts of red, green, and blue, and then we will add white to reach the total amount of 130ml while adjusting the color to match the target as closely as possible.

The previous plan has a few issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the plan does not account for the correct proportions of red, green, and blue to match the target color. Secondly, the plan does not correctly maintain the target volume of 130ml, as it ends up with 160ml in beaker 5. Lastly, the plan does not consider the subtractive color mixing model properly, as it attempts to mix colors by removing and adding back portions of the mixture, which is not how subtractive color mixing works.

To create the target color RGB(254, 222, 197) with an amount of 130ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions, and we will likely need to use white to achieve the light pastel shade of the target color.

The target color is predominantly red, with significant amounts of green and a slightly lower amount of blue. We will start by adding red, then green, and blue in proportions that reflect the target color's RGB values. We will also add white to lighten the color to the pastel shade required.

To maintain the correct volume, we will calculate the proportions of each color based on the target RGB values and the total amount of paint needed. We will then add the colors to beaker 5 in these proportions, adjusting as necessary to match the target color.

Here is the breakdown of the target RGB values proportionally to the amount of paint we need:
- Red: (254/673) * 130 ≈ 49ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Green: (222/673) * 130 ≈ 43ml
- Blue: (197/673) * 130 ≈ 38ml
- White: The remaining amount to reach 130ml

We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors. We will start by adding the calculated amounts of red, green, and blue, and then we will add white to reach the total amount of 130ml while adjusting the color to match the target as closely as possible.

The previous plan has several issues that need to be addressed. The most critical mistake is the misunderstanding of the subtractive color mixing model. In subtractive color mixing, you cannot remove and add back portions of the mixture to adjust the color; instead, you must mix the correct proportions of colors from the start.

The target color RGB(254, 222, 197) is a very light pastel color, which means we will need a significant amount of white to achieve this lightness. The color is predominantly red, with a good amount of green and a smaller amount of blue. To achieve the correct shade, we need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions and then lighten the mixture with white.

To maintain the correct volume of 130ml, we need to calculate the proportions of each color based on the target RGB values and the total amount of paint needed. We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors. We will start by adding the calculated amounts of red, green, and blue, and then we will add white to reach the total amount of 130ml while adjusting the color to match the target as closely as possible.

Here is the breakdown of the target RGB values proportionally to the amount of paint we need:
- Red: (254/673) * 130 ≈ 49ml (rounded to the nearest whole number)
- Green: (222/673) * 130 ≈ 43ml
- Blue: (197/673) * 130 ≈ 38ml
- White: The remaining amount to reach 130ml, which is 130 - (49+43+38) = 0ml (since the sum of red, green, and blue already equals 130ml)

However, since the target color is very light, we will need to adjust the proportions to include white. We will start by adding less of the primary colors to leave room for white. Let's try the following proportions:
- Red: 40ml
- Green: 35ml
- Blue: 30ml
- White: 130 - (40+35+30) = 25ml

We will adjust these proportions if necessary after mixing to achieve the closest match to the target color.
