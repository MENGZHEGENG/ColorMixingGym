To create the target color RGB(30, 157, 152) with an amount of 131ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. The target color is a shade of teal, which means we need more green and blue than red. Since we have pure red, green, and blue colors, we can start by determining the ratios of these colors in the target color.

The target color has the following RGB values:
- Red: 30
- Green: 157
- Blue: 152

We can see that green and blue are the dominant colors. To simplify the mixing process, we can first try to match the ratio of green to blue, which is very close to 1:1. Since we need a total of 131ml, we can start by mixing approximately 65ml of green and 65ml of blue to get a base color. Then we can add red in small amounts until we reach the desired shade.

However, we also have white and black paint, which can be used to adjust the brightness and saturation of the color without changing the hue. The target color is quite dark, so we might need to use some black paint to achieve the correct darkness.

Here's a rough plan:
1. Mix equal parts of green and blue to get a base teal color.
2. Add red paint in small increments to adjust the hue towards the target color.
3. Use black paint to darken the color if necessary.

Since we need to be precise with the amounts, we will start with the base teal color and then adjust with red and black as needed. We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker.

Let's start by mixing 65ml of green and 65ml of blue to get a base color of RGB(0, 65, 65). This will give us 130ml of paint, which is 1ml less than the target amount. We can then add 1ml of red to get closer to the target amount and start adjusting the color. We will need to add more red, but we should do it in small steps to avoid overshooting the target color.

We will use the following steps to create the target color:

The previous plan aimed to create a teal color by mixing equal parts of green and blue, then adjusting with red and black. However, the plan did not account for the specific RGB values of the target color, which are quite low for red and relatively high for green and blue. The target color RGB(30, 157, 152) suggests that we need a lot more green and blue than red, and the color is quite dark, which means we might need to use black to adjust the darkness.

To achieve the target color, we should consider the following:
- The target color has low red (30), high green (157), and high blue (152), which suggests a teal color with a slight green dominance.
- The total amount of paint needed is 131ml, which means we need to be careful with the proportions to avoid exceeding this amount.
- We have black paint available, which can be used to darken the color without affecting the hue too much.

Given these considerations, we should start by creating a base teal color with green and blue, then add red and black to adjust the hue and darkness. We will use beaker 5 as our mixing beaker.

Here's a revised plan:
1. Mix green and blue to get a base teal color, with slightly more green than blue to match the target color's higher green value.
2. Add a small amount of red to adjust the hue.
3. Use black paint to darken the color to match the target's darkness.

We will start by mixing 66ml of green and 65ml of blue to get a base color close to the target's green and blue values. This will give us 131ml of paint, which is the target amount. We will then add red and black in very small increments to fine-tune the color.

Let's calculate the proportions based on the target RGB values:
- The sum of the RGB values in the target color is 30 + 157 + 152 = 339.
- To find the proportion of each color, we divide each RGB value by the sum and then multiply by the total amount of paint (131ml).
- Red proportion: (30/339) * 131 ≈ 11.6ml
- Green proportion: (157/339) * 131 ≈ 60.5ml
- Blue proportion: (152/339) * 131 ≈ 58.9ml

Since we can only use whole numbers, we will round these values to the nearest whole number and adjust as needed. We will start with 11ml of red, 61ml of green, and 59ml of blue. This gives us a total of 131ml, matching the target amount. We will then adjust the color using black paint if necessary.

The previous plan has a logical approach to creating a color that matches the target beaker's RGB values. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The previous plan does not account for the subtractive color mixing model properly. In subtractive color mixing, colors are created by subtracting light from white. This means that adding colors together will result in a darker color, not a lighter one. Therefore, starting with white paint and adding colors to it will not work in this scenario.

2. The previous plan exceeds the target amount of 131ml by adding black paint after already reaching the target amount with the base colors. This would result in a total amount greater than the desired 131ml.

3. The previous plan does not consider the specific proportions needed to achieve the target color. The target color has a very low red component, a high green component, and a blue component that is almost equal to the green component.

To correct these issues, we need to adjust the plan as follows:

- We will not use white paint, as it is not needed for the subtractive color mixing model.
- We will calculate the proportions of each color based on the target RGB values and ensure that the total amount does not exceed 131ml.
- We will use black paint to darken the color if necessary, but we will ensure that the total amount of paint remains at 131ml.

Given the target color RGB(30, 157, 152), we can see that we need a base of green and blue with a very small amount of red. We will start by mixing green and blue to get a base teal color, then add red to adjust the hue. If the color is too bright, we will add black to darken it, but we will make sure to adjust the amounts of the other colors to keep the total volume at 131ml.

Let's calculate the proportions based on the target RGB values:
- The sum of the RGB values in the target color is 30 + 157 + 152 = 339.
- To find the proportion of each color, we divide each RGB value by the sum and then multiply by the total amount of paint (131ml).
- Red proportion: (30/339) * 131 ≈ 11.6ml
- Green proportion: (157/339) * 131 ≈ 60.5ml
- Blue proportion: (152/339) * 131 ≈ 58.9ml

Since we can only use whole numbers, we will round these values to the nearest whole number and adjust as needed. We will start with 11ml of red, 61ml of green, and 59ml of blue. This gives us a total of 131ml, matching the target amount. We will then adjust the color using black paint if necessary, but we will subtract the same amount from one of the other colors to maintain the total volume.

Here's the revised plan:
1. Mix green and blue to get a base teal color, with slightly more green than blue to match the target color's higher green value.
2. Add a small amount of red to adjust the hue.
3. If necessary, use black paint to darken the color, but adjust the amounts of other colors to keep the total volume at 131ml.
