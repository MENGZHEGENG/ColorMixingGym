To create the target color RGB(224, 28, 227) in beaker 5, we need to mix red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. The target color is close to magenta, which is a mix of red and blue, with a very small amount of green. Since the target color has high values of red and blue, we will need to mix a lot of red (from beaker 0) and blue (from beaker 2), with a very small amount of green (from beaker 1) to achieve the correct shade.

Given that the target amount is 106ml, we need to calculate the proportions of each color. The red and blue values are almost equal, and the green value is very low. We can start by equally dividing the 106ml between red and blue, and then adjust the amounts to fine-tune the color.

Let's start with an approximate division:
- Red: 53ml (half of 106ml)
- Blue: 53ml (half of 106ml)
- Green: A small amount, let's start with 2ml to not overpower the other colors.

This gives us a total of 108ml, which is slightly over the target amount. We need to adjust the amounts to get exactly 106ml. We can reduce both red and blue by 1ml each to get the correct total amount.

Adjusted amounts:
- Red: 52ml
- Blue: 52ml
- Green: 2ml

This should give us a color close to the target RGB(224, 28, 227) and the correct amount of 106ml. We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors.

Note: The exact color may vary slightly due to the subtractive color mixing model, and further adjustments may be needed based on feedback.

The previous plan aimed to create a magenta-like color by mixing red and blue with a very small amount of green. The reasoning was sound, given the RGB values of the target color (RGB(224, 28, 227)), which suggest a color close to magenta with a very low green component.

However, the previous plan did not account for the white and black paints available in beakers 3 and 4, which can be used to adjust the brightness and saturation of the color. Since the target color is not a pure magenta (RGB(255, 0, 255)), but rather a slightly less saturated and slightly brighter version, we should consider using white to increase brightness and potentially black to adjust saturation.

The target color has a high red and blue value (224 out of 255), which means we need to mix red and blue in high amounts but not at full saturation. The green value is very low (28 out of 255), so we only need a small amount of green. To achieve the correct brightness, we can add a bit of white.

To fine-tune the color, we can start with the previous plan's base and then adjust as follows:
- Add white to increase the brightness of the color.
- If necessary, add a tiny amount of black to decrease the saturation.

We will continue to use beaker 5 to mix our colors. The target amount is 106ml, so we need to ensure that the total volume of paint we mix does not exceed this amount.

Let's adjust the previous plan's amounts to include white:
- Red: 52ml
- Blue: 52ml
- Green: 2ml
- White: To be determined based on the desired brightness.

We will start by adding a small amount of white and then adjust if necessary. Let's try with 5ml of white, which will bring our total to 111ml. We will then need to reduce the red and blue by 2.5ml each to maintain the target amount of 106ml.

Adjusted amounts:
- Red: 49.5ml (rounded to 50ml for simplicity)
- Blue: 49.5ml (rounded to 50ml for simplicity)
- Green: 2ml
- White: 5ml

This should give us a color close to the target RGB(224, 28, 227) and the correct amount of 106ml. We will round the red and blue amounts to the nearest whole number for the plan since we cannot pour half milliliters.

Note: The exact color may vary slightly due to the subtractive color mixing model, and further adjustments may be needed based on feedback.

The previous plan provided a good starting point for creating a color close to the target RGB(224, 28, 227). However, the plan did not account for the fact that we cannot pour half milliliters, and it also did not include the use of black paint to adjust saturation. Additionally, the previous plan resulted in a total volume of 106ml, which is correct, but the color might not be an exact match due to the proportions used.

To create the target color, we need to mix red and blue to get a magenta-like color, add a small amount of green to match the green component, and then adjust the brightness and saturation with white and black.

Given the high values of red and blue in the target color, we should start by mixing equal amounts of red and blue. The green component is very low, so we will add a small amount of green. To adjust the brightness, we will add white paint, and to adjust the saturation, we will add a small amount of black paint if necessary.

The target amount is 106ml, so we need to ensure that the total volume of paint we mix does not exceed this amount. We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors.

Let's create a new plan with the following steps:
- Mix equal amounts of red and blue to create a base magenta color.
- Add a small amount of green to match the green component of the target color.
- Add white to increase the brightness to match the target color.
- If the color is too saturated, add a small amount of black to decrease the saturation.

We will start with the following amounts and adjust if necessary:
- Red: 50ml
- Blue: 50ml
- Green: 2ml
- White: 4ml (to increase brightness without exceeding the target volume)

This will give us a total of 106ml. If the color is too saturated, we will add black in small increments and adjust the other colors accordingly to maintain the target volume.

Note: The exact color may vary slightly due to the subtractive color mixing model, and further adjustments may be needed based on feedback.
