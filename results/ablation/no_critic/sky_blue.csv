To create the target color RGB(19, 132, 216) with an amount of 82ml, we need to mix the primary colors red, green, and blue in the correct proportions. The target color is a shade of blue with a small amount of red and a moderate amount of green.

We have the following beakers with primary colors:
- Beaker 0: Red (RGB 255, 0, 0)
- Beaker 1: Green (RGB 0, 255, 0)
- Beaker 2: Blue (RGB 0, 0, 255)

We also have white and black paint, which can be used to lighten or darken the color if necessary:
- Beaker 3: White (RGB 255, 255, 255)
- Beaker 4: Black (RGB 0, 0, 0)

Since the target color is predominantly blue, we will start by pouring a large proportion of blue paint. The target color has a blue value of 216 out of 255, which is approximately 84.7% of the maximum for blue. The red and green values are much lower, with red being about 7.5% and green about 51.8% of their respective maximums.

To simplify, we can start by trying to match these percentages in our mixture. Since we need a total of 82ml, we can calculate the approximate amounts of each color needed:
- Blue: 82ml * 84.7% ≈ 69ml
- Green: 82ml * 51.8% ≈ 42ml
- Red: 82ml * 7.5% ≈ 6ml

These amounts add up to more than 82ml because there is overlap in the percentages (they are not independent). We will need to adjust the amounts to ensure the total volume is 82ml while keeping the proportions as close as possible to the target color.

We will use beaker 5 to mix our colors. We can start by adding blue, then green, and finally red. We will need to adjust the amounts to ensure we do not exceed 82ml in total. We can start with the largest component (blue) and then proportionally add the other colors.

Let's start with 69ml of blue. We will then need to reduce the amounts of green and red to ensure the total does not exceed 82ml. If we add 42ml of green, we would exceed the total amount, so we will add less green and red proportionally.

We can calculate the new amounts by maintaining the ratio of green to blue and red to blue from the target color:
- Green to blue ratio: 132/216 ≈ 0.61
- Red to blue ratio: 19/216 ≈ 0.09

Using 69ml of blue as our base, we can calculate the new amounts for green and red:
- Green: 69ml * 0.61 ≈ 42ml (but we will adjust this down to fit the 82ml total)
- Red: 69ml * 0.09 ≈ 6ml (but we will adjust this down to fit the 82ml total)

To fit the 82ml total, we can adjust the green and red amounts as follows:
- Total blue and red: 69ml + 6ml = 75ml
- Remaining for green: 82ml - 75ml = 7ml

However, this would not give us enough green to match the target color's green to blue ratio. We need to reduce the amount of blue to increase the amount of green while keeping the total at 82ml. Let's try 65ml of blue, which would give us:
- Remaining for green and red: 82ml - 65ml = 17ml

Now we can distribute the 17ml between green and red according to their ratios:
- Green: 17ml * (132 / (132 + 19)) ≈ 15ml
- Red: 17ml * (19 / (132 + 19)) ≈ 2ml

This gives us a new mixture plan:
- Blue: 65ml
- Green: 15ml
- Red: 2ml

The total is now 65ml + 15ml + 2ml = 82ml, which matches our target amount. We will use these amounts for our plan.

The previous plan has a solid approach to creating the target color by calculating the proportions of each primary color based on the target RGB values. However, the plan does not account for the fact that the RGB color model is additive, not subtractive. In an additive color model, colors are created by combining light of different colors, whereas in a subtractive color model, colors are created by combining pigments (paints) that absorb (subtract) different parts of the light spectrum.

In a subtractive color mixing environment, mixing paints of different colors results in a darker color because each paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light. The more paint you mix, the more light is absorbed, and the darker the color becomes. This means that mixing equal parts of all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) would result in black or a very dark color, not white as it would in an additive color model.

Given this, we need to adjust the previous plan to account for the subtractive nature of the color mixing environment. The target color RGB(19, 132, 216) is a light blue, which means we need to start with a base of blue paint and then carefully add small amounts of red and green to achieve the desired shade without making the color too dark.

Since the target color has a high blue component, we will use blue as our base. The red and green values are lower, indicating that we need less of these colors. We will also need to consider the total amount of paint we want to end up with, which is 82ml.

To achieve the target color, we will start by pouring a majority of blue paint into the mixing beaker (beaker 5), and then add smaller amounts of green and red. We will not use white or black paint in this case, as they would lighten or darken the color too much for the light blue shade we are aiming for.

Let's start with a base of 65ml of blue paint, which is the majority of the 82ml target amount. We will then add green and red in smaller proportions to adjust the color to the target. We will use the ratios of the target color's green to blue (132/216) and red to blue (19/216) to determine the amounts of green and red to add.

Using 65ml of blue as our base, we can calculate the new amounts for green and red:
- Green: 65ml * (132/216) ≈ 40ml
- Red: 65ml * (19/216) ≈ 6ml

However, adding 40ml of green and 6ml of red to 65ml of blue would exceed our target amount of 82ml. We need to adjust these values to ensure the total volume is correct. We can do this by scaling down the amounts of green and red while maintaining their relative proportions to blue.

Let's try reducing the amount of blue to 60ml to leave more room for green and red. This would give us:
- Green: 60ml * (132/216) ≈ 37ml
- Red: 60ml * (19/216) ≈ 5ml

Adding these amounts would still exceed 82ml, so we need to scale down further. Let's reduce the blue to 55ml and recalculate:
- Green: 55ml * (132/216) ≈ 33ml
- Red: 55ml * (19/216) ≈ 5ml

This gives us a total of 55ml + 33ml + 5ml = 93ml, which is still too much. We need to reduce the amounts further. Let's try 50ml of blue:
- Green: 50ml * (132/216) ≈ 30ml
- Red: 50ml * (19/216) ≈ 4ml

This gives us a total of 50ml + 30ml + 4ml = 84ml, which is very close to our target amount. We can adjust slightly by reducing the green by 2ml:
- Green: 28ml
- Red: 4ml

Now we have a total of 50ml + 28ml + 4ml = 82ml, which matches our target amount. We will use these amounts for our plan.
