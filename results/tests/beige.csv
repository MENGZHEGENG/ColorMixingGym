The target beaker color is a light beige color, which means it will require a mix of red, green, and blue in specific proportions. Since the target beaker amount is 130ml, I will need to ensure that the total amount of paint in the final beaker matches this volume. I will start by calculating the proportions of red, green, and blue needed to achieve the target color. Once I have the proportions, I will then plan the sequence of actions to mix the colors in the correct amounts to achieve the target color and volume.

The planner did a good job of calculating the proportions of red, green, and blue needed to achieve the target color. The relative ratios of red, green, and blue paint in the produced mixture are close to the target mixture, which is a good aspect to keep in the next iteration.

However, the produced color RGB(128, 77, 51) is quite far from the target color RGB(254, 222, 197). The color is not bright enough and does not match the light beige color of the target beaker.

To improve the plan, we can make use of the white paint in beaker 3 to make the mixture brighter. I would suggest adding a substantial amount of white paint (perhaps 50 ml) to the mixture initially and then adding the correct ratios of red, green, and blue. If this turns out to be too much white paint, we can adjust it in the next planning iteration.

Good things you did:
1. The relative ratios of red, green, and blue paint in the produced mixture are good
    - You did a good job calculating ratios within your reasoning prior to the plan

Things to improve:
1. The produced color RGB(128, 77, 51) is not bright enough and does not match the target color RGB(254, 222, 197)
    - I would suggest you add a substantial amount of white paint (maybe 50 ml of white to the mixture) initially
    and then add the correct ratios of red, green, and blue (if this is too much white we can reduce it in the next iteration)

Based on the feedback, I need to adjust the plan to incorporate a substantial amount of white paint to lighten the final color. I will start by adding 50ml of white paint to the empty beaker, and then proceed to add the correct ratios of red, green, and blue paint to achieve the target color.

I will also need to recalculate the proportions of red, green, and blue needed to achieve the target color, taking into account the addition of white paint.

The planner's reasoning was good in terms of recognizing the need to adjust the plan to incorporate a substantial amount of white paint to lighten the final color. The addition of 50ml of white paint to the empty beaker was a good starting point. The planner also correctly recalculated the proportions of red, green, and blue needed to achieve the target color, taking into account the addition of white paint.

The trajectory shows that the planner's actions resulted in a gradual approach to achieving the target color, which is a good strategy. However, the final color in beaker 5 is still not quite close to the target color. It seems that the proportions of red, green, and blue paint added were not quite accurate.

    - I would suggest adjusting the proportions of red, green, and blue paint added to beaker 5 to better match the target color. You may need to experiment with different ratios to achieve the desired result. Consider adding more red and green paint to achieve the target color of RGB(254, 222, 197).
