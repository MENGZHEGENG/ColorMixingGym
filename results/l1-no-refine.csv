The target color is a light shade of blue with a bit of red and green mixed in. Since the RGB values for the target are (137, 153, 255), we can see that blue is the dominant color, followed by green and then red.

To achieve the target amount of 135ml, we need to mix the colors in the correct proportions. We can start by determining the ratio of each color in the target beaker:

- Red: 137 / (137 + 153 + 255) = 137 / 545
- Green: 153 / (137 + 153 + 255) = 153 / 545
- Blue: 255 / (137 + 153 + 255) = 255 / 545

Now, we need to calculate the amount of each color needed to reach the target amount of 135ml:

- Red: (137 / 545) * 135 ≈ 34ml
- Green: (153 / 545) * 135 ≈ 38ml
- Blue: (255 / 545) * 135 ≈ 63ml

Since we have to use whole numbers and the sum of the amounts must equal the target amount, we can round the values to the nearest whole number, but we need to ensure that the total adds up to 135ml. We can adjust the values slightly to:

- Red: 34ml
- Green: 38ml
- Blue: 63ml

However, this adds up to 135ml, which is exactly our target amount. We can use beaker 3 as our mixing beaker.

Let's proceed with the plan.

The target color is a shade of teal, which is a mix of green and blue with a very small amount of red. Since the target RGB value is (21, 144, 164), we can see that blue is the dominant color, followed by green, and then a small amount of red.

Given that the target amount is 128ml, we need to calculate the proportions of each primary color to achieve the target color. We can use the RGB values as a guide for the proportions. The sum of the RGB values is 21 + 144 + 164 = 329. To find the proportion of each color, we divide each RGB value by the sum and then multiply by the target amount:

- Red proportion: (21 / 329) * 128 ≈ 8.2ml (rounded to 8ml for simplicity)
- Green proportion: (144 / 329) * 128 ≈ 56ml
- Blue proportion: (164 / 329) * 128 ≈ 64ml

Since we can only use whole numbers, we need to adjust these values to ensure they add up to 128ml. We can round the red down to 8ml, the green to 56ml, and the blue to 64ml. This gives us a total of 128ml, which matches the target amount.

We will use beaker 3 as our mixing beaker. We will start by pouring the blue paint, followed by the green, and finally adding the small amount of red.

In this color-mixing environment, I have primary colors red, green, and blue in equal amounts of 100ml each. The target color is a shade of green with a higher proportion of green, followed by red, and then blue. The target amount is 120ml, which is more than the amount in any single beaker, so I will need to mix colors in the empty beaker 3.

The RGB values of the target color are (76, 107, 43). To achieve this color, I need to mix the colors in the correct proportions. Since the green value (107) is the highest, I will start by adding green paint to beaker 3. Then, I will add red and blue in smaller amounts to achieve the target color.

To determine the exact amounts of each color to mix, I will use the ratios of the RGB values in the target color. The sum of the RGB values is 76 + 107 + 43 = 226. To find out how much of each color to use, I will calculate the proportion of each color in the target mix:

- Red: (76 / 226) * 120ml ≈ 40ml
- Green: (107 / 226) * 120ml ≈ 57ml
- Blue: (43 / 226) * 120ml ≈ 23ml

These are approximate values, and I will round them to the nearest whole number to comply with the instructions of not using mathematical expressions in the POUR parameters. The sum of these amounts is 40 + 57 + 23 = 120ml, which matches the target amount.

I will now create a plan based on these calculations.

The target color is a shade of blue with a small amount of red and a moderate amount of green. Since the environment uses a subtractive color mixing model, we need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions to achieve the target color. The target beaker requires 82ml of paint with RGB values of (19, 132, 216). 

To achieve the target color, we need to mix more blue than green and only a small amount of red. Since the RGB values of the target are not in simple ratios, we will need to approximate the proportions. 

The blue component is the highest, so we will start by adding blue paint. The green component is the next highest, so we will add green paint next. Finally, we will add a small amount of red paint to achieve the desired color.

We can use beaker 3 as our mixing beaker. We will start by pouring blue paint into it, then green, and finally red. We need to make sure the total amount of paint we pour is 82ml.

Let's estimate the proportions based on the RGB values of the target color:
- Blue: 216 out of the total 367 (19+132+216), approximately 59% of the mixture
- Green: 132 out of 367, approximately 36% of the mixture
- Red: 19 out of 367, approximately 5% of the mixture

Now, we calculate the amounts for each color based on the percentages:
- Blue: 59% of 82ml is approximately 48ml
- Green: 36% of 82ml is approximately 30ml
- Red: 5% of 82ml is approximately 4ml

These are rough estimates and may need to be adjusted slightly to ensure the total amount is 82ml. We will round the amounts to the nearest whole number for the POUR action.

The target color is a shade of magenta, which is a mix of red and blue with a dominant red component, as indicated by the high red (224) and blue (227) values in the RGB code, and a very small amount of green (28). Since the target amount is 106ml, I need to calculate the proportions of each color to mix.

To approximate the target color, I will need to mix a large amount of red and blue, with a very small amount of green. The red and blue values are almost equal, so they will be mixed in nearly equal amounts, with a slight preference for red to match the RGB values more closely.

I will use beaker 3 to mix my colors. Since the target amount is 106ml, I will try to get close to the RGB values proportionally. I will start by pouring 53ml of red and 52ml of blue to get a base magenta color. Then, I will add a small amount of green to slightly shift the color towards the target.

The exact proportions might need to be adjusted after the initial mix if the color is not as expected, but this will be my starting plan.

Let's calculate the approximate amounts to pour:
- Red: (224 / (224 + 28 + 227)) * 106 ≈ 53ml
- Green: (28 / (224 + 28 + 227)) * 106 ≈ 1ml
- Blue: (227 / (224 + 28 + 227)) * 106 ≈ 52ml

Since we can only pour whole numbers and the total amount should be 106ml, I will adjust the amounts to:
- Red: 53ml
- Green: 1ml
- Blue: 52ml

This gives us a total of 106ml, matching the target amount.

In this color-mixing environment, I have primary colors red, green, and blue in equal amounts, and an empty beaker to mix my target color. The target color has an RGB value of (62, 25, 48) and requires a total volume of 86ml.

To achieve the target color, I need to mix the primary colors in the correct proportions. The target color is a shade of purple with a higher red component, a lower green component, and a moderate blue component. Since the environment uses a subtractive color mixing model, I need to consider the proportions carefully.

I will start by determining the ratios of the RGB components in the target color. The sum of the RGB values is 62 + 25 + 48 = 135. To find the ratio of each color, I divide each component by the sum:

- Red ratio: 62 / 135
- Green ratio: 25 / 135
- Blue ratio: 48 / 135

Next, I will calculate the amount of each color needed to reach the total volume of 86ml:

- Red amount: (62 / 135) * 86
- Green amount: (25 / 135) * 86
- Blue amount: (48 / 135) * 86

These calculations will give me the approximate amounts of each color to mix. I will round these to the nearest whole number since the POUR action only accepts integers.

Finally, I will use beaker 3 to mix the colors, starting with the color that requires the most volume and ending with the color that requires the least. This way, I can adjust the final color by adding small amounts of paint if necessary.

Once the mixing is complete, I will use the DONE action to indicate that beaker 3 contains the desired mixture.

The target color is a shade of brown, which typically requires a mixture of red, green, and a small amount of blue. The RGB values of the target beaker suggest that red is the dominant color, followed by green, and then blue. Since the target amount is 67ml, I need to calculate the proportions of each color to match the target RGB values as closely as possible.

The RGB values of the target are (99, 52, 46). To simplify the calculation, I can try to match the ratios of these values within the 67ml constraint. The sum of the RGB values is 99 + 52 + 46 = 197. To find the proportion of each color, I can divide each RGB value by the total sum and then multiply by the target amount (67ml).

For red: (99 / 197) * 67 ≈ 33.7ml
For green: (52 / 197) * 67 ≈ 17.7ml
For blue: (46 / 197) * 67 ≈ 15.6ml

Since I can only use whole numbers, I will round these values to the nearest whole number:
Red: 34ml
Green: 18ml
Blue: 15ml

These values add up to 34 + 18 + 15 = 67ml, which is the target amount. I will use beaker 3 to mix the colors.

The target color is a shade of orange, which is made by mixing red and green in the right proportions. Since there is no yellow paint to start with, I'll have to mix red and green to get the orange hue. The RGB value of the target color is (255, 162, 0), which means it is fully saturated with red and has a significant amount of green, but no blue.

To achieve the target amount of 150ml, I need to consider the proportions of red and green. Since the red value is at maximum (255) and the green is at 162, the ratio of red to green is roughly 255:162. Simplifying this ratio, I get approximately 3:2 (since 255/85 = 3 and 162/85 = 2). This means for every 3 parts of red, I need 2 parts of green.

To get 150ml of paint in this ratio, I can use 90ml of red and 60ml of green (since 90ml red + 60ml green = 150ml total, and 90/30 = 3, 60/30 = 2, which maintains the 3:2 ratio).

I will use beaker 3 to mix the colors. First, I'll pour 90ml of red from beaker 0 into beaker 3, and then I'll pour 60ml of green from beaker 1 into beaker 3. There is no need to use blue paint from beaker 2 since the target color has no blue component.

The target color is a very light shade of orange, which means I need to mix red and green to get orange and then add a significant amount of white to lighten it. Since I don't have white, I can simulate it by using all three primary colors (red, green, blue) in such a way that the mixture is much lighter than the primary colors themselves. The RGB values of the target color are very high and close to each other, with red being the highest, followed by green, and then blue.

To achieve the target amount of 130ml, I need to plan the proportions of each color carefully. Since the red value is the highest, I will start by adding a large amount of red. The green value is slightly lower, so I will add a little less green than red. The blue value is the lowest, so I will add even less blue.

I will use beaker 3 as my mixing beaker. I will start by adding red and green to get an orange base. Then, I will add a small amount of blue to lighten the color. I will adjust the amounts to get as close as possible to the target color while also reaching the target volume of 130ml.

Let's assume I start with 60ml of red and 50ml of green to create a base orange color. This gives me 110ml of paint. I then need to add 20ml of blue to reach the target volume. This will lighten the color, but it may not be enough to reach the desired lightness. I may need to adjust the amounts after mixing to get closer to the target color.

Here's an initial plan:
- 60ml of red (255, 0, 0)
- 50ml of green (0, 255, 0)
- 20ml of blue (0, 0, 255)
